1,Cats,2020-01-04,Follow your instinct,"It was great! Honestly. How was it not going to be weird and oddly sexual? It's Cats! 

If, like me, you remember the show from your childhood, have a musical child interested in dance and theatre, and are constantly looking for something without the constant, high-impact peril of most 'kids' ' shows, then look no further. I'm so glad I followed my instincts and took my 3yo boy to this.

He was initially alarmed but I had told him before that it was about people pretending to be cats. He didn't understand much of what was being said - after all, some of the content is 100 years old now - but I was whispering in his ear, 'it's an old lady / magic / mean / naughty / dustbin / pirate cat', and he was fine. He got a bit fidgety towards the end, and kept asking if it was finished yet, but he insisted on staying till the last line of the credits, and instantly asked me, 'Can we watch it again?'

Yes there are some hmm, controversial choices like Rebel Wilson's 'catsuit' and the cats wearing Timberlands (it's because they were street dancing, and wonderfully too). But there are also some extraordinary moments, like the beautiful ballet dancing by male and female leads, and Skimbleshanks' fantastic tap sequence. Honestly if you have an imaginative child interested in dance and performance, what's not to love? 

The scale was weird, but fun. As you'd expect, 40 years on there's an injection of more jeopardy, more romance, but all this was pretty easy to ignore in favour of the sheer spectacle. Just marvellous, and boo to the cynics. I can't believe how many people are sneering at it, but then again, in today's world people are pretty cynical. It was totally generous and good-hearted.

View it like going to the ballet, don't expect too much coherence, and sit back and revel in the madness. I plan to buy it on DVD and watch repeatedly as my kids grow and learn more dance!Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models']",3,Adult,Unk,10,3,5
2,Cats,2019-12-27,Magical Musical,"I saw it last weekend with my 4.5 year old. I thought it was great and my daughter LOVED it. She’s still singing “Jelicle Cats” and still complaining that I made her run to the bathroom to pee during a song and she missed a tiny part of the movie. 

Some parts were a little bit “sexy”, in my opinion, but the innuendos were seemingly over her head. She was completely interested and focused the whole time and very invested in the story line. If your child has a hard time listening to or understanding music lyrics, maybe wait until they are older. There is essentially no dialogue in the film so they have to understand what the songs mean.

12,Cats,2019-12-31,"TS. Eliot didn't want to sell his work to Disney as they might turn it into childish fun. Sir Andrew Loyed Webber promised not to do that and he delivered. This new version completely overturns that and creates a specialectical shallow and without humour, even trying too hard to achieve this. Absolute fail, all the big names looked uneasy and unconvincing. My loyalty shall remain solidly with the musical production.",,,3,Adult,Unk,10,4,1
13,Cats,2019-12-29,Under that thick cat fur...,"I know that many people feel it's a surreal film. It's Andrew Lloyd Webber, after all. I remember getting freaked out, as a kid, with the trailer of the 1998 direct-to-video version. It was just before Joseph started, on VHS. The sentiments were perfectly relatable, in my opinion.

But, under that thick cat fur, the film isn't that bad. Especially, if you love musicals, an ALW fan (like myself, included) or/and don't find Motion-Capture films (Tintin, Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol all spring to mind) jarring. You might not find this one as bad as the majority thinks.

There are few scary moments with Macavity, played by Idris Elba. But, he does get thrawted, at the end of the picture and those moments aren't that long. Plus, there are loads of moments that promote empathy and being welcoming. Victoria (Frankie Haywood, great dancer and first-time singer) obviously got thrown away by her owner (the owner, whom we don't see in the frame, is the only live-action element of the picture). But, they eventually make her feel at home and encourage to be her own person. She was also the first cat that notices Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson, from The Voice franchise), who gets bullied and treated like an alien by the other cats. Even though, it was mentioned that Macavity was directly responsible for messing up her life. But, Grizabella does have a happy ending, like what Victoria got, too.

Also, all of the vocals are recorded live on set, like what Tom Hooper did in Les Miserables with Simon Haynes (Simon reunites with Tom on this film, reprising his role from Les Mis). Since, this film is sung-through, it makes a lot of sense to do that. I'm glad Universal and Amblin (they actually nearly made a traditionally-animated version it, before Balto bombed at the Box Office) didn't interfere and make Tom pre-record the vocals to have them mimed on set.  It would have been a ghastly move, since we have the technologies to go back to doing it now.

The Acting, Musical Numbers (a few were re-worked by Chic and Nile Rogers), Storyline and Style were the qualities that shone out as ""the jellicle cats."" Andrew's musicals may not be for everybody, though. He has been accused of plagiarism/being one-dimensional, as well as ""overrated."" But, as a person with Special Needs (Autism, that is), I thought that this film, as I have said before, was my ""jellicle choice.""

19,Cats,2019-12-24,Cats 2019 ~ What an experience :-),"Cats overflows with creativity and ardor and spirit and energy that comes from the cast onscreen and the people behind the scenes. The sets are mysteriously beautiful. But I think I was most impressed with the dancing choreographed by Andy Blankenbuehler and the dancers especially Francesca Hayward and Les Twins. But IMO all the Jellicle dancers put on an amazing show, so much so that there were moments in the film when I kind of wished director Tom Hooper had followed some of the full-cast dances a bit slower. But then again there is something to be said for Hooper's Infectious whirling effect. The singers are as good as the classic songs. Taylor Swift is a flirtatious Bombalurina who sings the nasty Macavity's (good job, Idris Elba) theme song as well as parts of ""Beautiful Ghosts"" &amp; the full version over the end credits. . Jennifer Hudson's tortured, emotional version of ""Memory"" works wonderfully most of the time, especially at the end. This ""Cats"" casts Victoria in the starring role of an innocent homeless kitten rescued by some of the Jellicle tribe. I don't want to be a spoiler so I'll just say Victoria has some adventures as she gets to know individual Jellicles, some more than others. She follows one of Grizabella's ""Memory"" preludes with a sweet and touching version of ""Beautiful Ghosts"". If I try to comment on everyone and everything that makes Cats Cats this would be a very very long review! So just a few more. 
Jason Derulo is lots of fun as the singing &amp; dancing &amp; catnip-to-kittens Rum Tum Tugger. The comic relief provided by various cast members was uneven, some good, some ""meh"" but these short scenes do make Cats more entertaining and give audience members a chance to catch their collective breath. The most marvelous ""performances by an actor"" were  Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy and Ian McKellen as Gus the Theatre Cat.  There is something so warm and inviting about Dame Judi's facial expressions; she was covered with just the right amount of digital fur so that the audience could be moved by them. Sir McKellen is a treasure.He plays an old, seen-it-all actor reminiscing   about his long theatrical career with a sense of pride and joy in his craft that is genuinely moving. Thank you, Andrew Lloyd Webber and everyone who brought this feline magical mystery tour to the P.S.

(Cat vids outnumber all others on every platform.)We appreciate their playful antics, that can be very familiar to us “Hoomans.” So Why Not enjoy a a playful musical, playing on all the fun of Cats! Great music, fun costumes, &amp; beautiful theater. 
  But if you are looking for a riveting plot, not the right movie..but seems quite appropriate as what would a story be like if your cat could tell you..Probably JUST LIKE THIS.  
  The cat costumes can be a bit sensual, (not overtly imo) but again, what do expect when you have a cat story..So maybe not great for that tender age when everything is seen as sexual (mainly puberty when Full of hormones) But use your judgement there’s no sex, violence, language drug use or even consumerism.

21,Cats,2021-01-25,Actually really nice movie!! Don't let the promotion fool you!,"Seriously, those people who complaints so much about this movie are clearly not familiar with its source material! CATS was first a book, that then became a stage musical which, despite its  mixed critics, have gotten a fanbase through the years. So it's only appropriate that they now made a movie version out of it. And for people, like myself, who haven't seen the stage show, it's actually really nice of them to make a movie version to experience at home. Not everyone are able travel to New York, or wherever it is,to see it. And don't let the promotion fool you, I mean, it is CATS! What else did you expect them to look like?? At least they tried to make them look kinda justice to the stage show.

Ok, let's talk about the movie itself. It is basically a story about the hard life as a street cat and how they are kinda living through all of it. I don't wanna say more or this review will be too long. But it is very nice, cute and a little bit sad. And the cast did a great job. I think the message is pretty much about respecting cats just as much as human.

So I would defenitly recommend this movie if you love musicals and want to see something a little different. And again for those people who's totally sawing it to pieces,  should defenitly give it a fair chance before they tend to do so.Show less",,3,Adult,Unk,10,6,4

The costumes in theater are buffered by the fact that they are 30-90 feet away, and on live dancers.  The movie has none of these good points, except the music.  The costumes which are OK from a distance on stage are turned into a nightmare with CG ""fixing"" and close ups. Some of the spots are very very creepy by the actor acting ""sexy"" while in fur.

Little did I know, my nine year old Jeremiah described a feeling none other than (sexual) arousal. We had to sit him down for ""the talk"" with the youth pastor after that. HORRIBLE.

Outstanding performances by Robbie Fairchild, Francesca Hayward, Judi Dench, Laurie Davidson and Jennifer Hudson. Taylor Swift was a complete dud. Sorry, girl.

I grew up with musicals, and remember seeing Cats in the theatre - so when the chance came to share it with my children I was ecstatic. It helps to listen to the songs before hand and get them singing along.
It's such a shame the online hate-machine ruined Cats before it even hit cinemas - I'll admit, I was put off by all the negative reviews - otherwise I'd have seen it in the cinema on Christmas.  This film is not intended for millennial film critics - the trailers make it look like a comedy - it's a musical, non-stop songs.

54,Cats,2019-12-30,Great rendition ,Wonderful portrayal of the onstage performance. We saw that in Chicago in ‘85. The actors are gifted and recognized despite the costumes. I do not understand the critics downgrading. It is and will be a classic.,,3,Adult,Unk,10,8,5
55,Cats,2019-12-29,Under that thick cat fur...,"I know that many people feel it's a surreal film. It's Andrew Lloyd Webber, after all. I remember getting freaked out, as a kid, with the trailer of the 1998 direct-to-video version. It was just before Joseph started, on VHS. The sentiments were perfectly relatable, in my opinion.

But, under that thick cat fur, the film isn't that bad. Especially, if you love musicals, an ALW fan (like myself, included) or/and don't find Motion-Capture films (Tintin, Polar Express, Beowulf, A Christmas Carol all spring to mind) jarring. You might not find this one as bad as the majority thinks.

There are few scary moments with Macavity, played by Idris Elba. But, he does get thrawted at the end of the picture and those moments don't last for that long. Plus, there are loads of moments that promote empathy and being welcoming. Victoria (Frankie Haywood, great dancer and first-time singer) obviously got thrown away by her owner (the owner, whom we don't see in the frame, is the only live-action element of the picture). But, they eventually make her feel at home and encourage to be her own person. She was also the first cat that notices Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson, from The Voice franchise), who gets bullied and treated like an alien by the other cats. Even though, it was mentioned that Macavity was directly responsible for messing up her life. But, Grizabella does have a happy ending, like what Victoria got, too.

Also, all of the vocals are recorded live on set, like what Tom Hooper did in Les Miserables with Simon Haynes (Simon reunites with Tom on this film, reprising his role on Les Mis). Since, this film is sung-through, it makes a lot of sense to do that. I'm glad Universal and Amblin (they actually nearly made a traditionally-animated version it, before Balto bombed at the Box Office) didn't interfere and make Tom pre-record the vocals to have them mimed on set.  It would have been a ghastly move, since we have the technologies to go back to doing it now.

The Acting, Musical Numbers (a few were re-worked by Chic and Nile Rogers), Storyline and Style were the qualities that shone out as ""the jellicle cats."" Andrew's musicals may not be for everybody, though. He has been accused of plagiarism/being one-dimensional, as well as ""overrated."" But, as a person with Special Needs (Autism, that is), I thought that this film, as I have said before, was my ""jellicle choice.""

80,Twilight,2010-10-26,This is not Love. This is Infatuated Obsession.,"Hate it.

Yes this movie/book promotes abstinence until marriage but that is all it does.

promoting abstinence is not enough to make this a good movie. 

It is an attractive storyline to adolescent girls not because it has good morals (it only has one) but because every low self-esteemed, angst ridden, hormonal teenager (and older single women) is going to easily relate to Bella (the main character). Not because she's easy to relate to but because she is a shell where the viewers are able to place their lives into it simply because Bella is not a 3-Dimensional character.

This is bad story telling. 

The message is NOT what I would ever let my Teenage daughter be exposed to (without thoroughly analyzing it).

Any parent worth their salt should take a closer look at the underlying message:

It is OK to become completely and blindly dependent on someone else without regard for logic or mental health.

It is OK to put yourself in harms way for someone else. 

It is OK to abuse your partner

It is OK to neglect all other facets of life

It is OK to become obsessed with one person to love that person only because of what they look like and not because of who they are. 

The above all happens in the book/movie between the main characters. And there are more reasons, these are just to name a few.

Edward is abusive, controlling and disrespectful to Bella - in spite of his traditional view with marriage.

Bella is (although book smart) passive, naive, obsessive, emotionally inept, impulsive, causes self harm, reckless, and cannot make smart decisions. 

The relationship between Bella and Edward, although passionate, is not Love. It is Infatuated Obsession. 

Why? Because NOT ONCE is Bella OR Edward attracted to each other by anything other than their looks/biology. 

Why does Bella love Edward? Because he's beautiful and is alluring. An aspect that all vampires carry in this book that does not serve to make Edward more unique and leaving only his beauty. Meaning? Bella only likes Edward because he is pretty. In the books, Bella repeatedly mentions Edward's looks -eyes, skin, breath. However, she never mentions an attraction to any other of his more ideal traits.

Why does Edward love Bella? It's not because she's smart, it's not because she's endearing. It is because she SMELLS good. 
It is admitted in both the book and movie that he is attracted to her because of the smell of her blood which he equates to his ""own personal brand of heroine"". 

This is not love. This is not a message any adolescent child should be exposed to when they are growing up, finding themselves and trying to understand the world they live in.

When Edward does stalker-ish or manipulative things, it is portrayed as romantic although in real life such behavior would constitute red flags.

Firstly the acting is awful.  If you do a YouTube search for ‘Twilight All The Stares’  you will understand.  Edward is very good at staring, Bella is almost as good at staring but offsets her staring ability by biting her lip a lot.   Kristen Stewart is a truly dire actress.

But this is not the movie’s only fault.  If only it was.  The entire premise is infuriating.  A summary of the plot:

An emotionally vulnerable teenage girl who has just moved away from her mother to live with her father in a new town meets a guy who is over 100 years old.  He is instantly infactuated by her.  He grooms her by telling her she cannot look after herself and needs to be looked after then isolates her from her peers, threatens to kill anyone who hurts her, forbids her from seeing her best friend, stalks her when she is out, watches her when she sleeps and tells her he will kill himself if she leaves him.

On the plus side he doesn’t believe in sex before marriage (although we discover in later movies beating your wife to a pulp during sex is fine as long as you are sorry and love them).

90,Twilight,2014-10-05,Just Don't,"I don't think watching this will harm anyone that much mentally, although there are some things to consider. First off, I have to admit, I've seen the first 3 films and I have read the complete series, I read the books first and started really turning my opinions of this series when the movie came out. The acting is really bad in this film, I really do think it is mainly the lead, Kristen Stewart's acting that makes this film completely uncomfortable to watch, but that's a personal opinion on someone's acting skills. The script for this movie wasn't well done, in most movies they create from books, they have to cut stuff out, in this film however they could have made some stuff up, probably would have helped the movie. It isn't that interesting until you get to the end when there actually is the only bit of violence and action in the film, the rest is quite boring besides when she almost gets hit by a van, that's a little interesting. Most people could probably watch this movie and have an opinion that it was neither good nor bad if they didn't deal with the hype this movie created and they hadn't read the books originally, but because I did both, this movie was such a let down. Although one good thing about the movie, it helped young me see how twisted this book was. It is inappropriate no matter who you are, to sneak into someone's house to watch them sleep, however this happens in the movie and the book, it's creepy. Not only that, but they used this very creepy, stalker-like move and pegged it off as being romantic, which it isn't and no one should be taught it was. Also, and this is digging past the storyline and into the characters, the fact that this series has created a female lead character that is not only so helpless, but can be quite stupid at times as well, is just boring on sexism. The worst part, this was written by a woman who is being sexist towards women by saying you either need to be another species (Ie Werewolf/ Vampire) or a man to be powerful because who helps her?

112,Twilight,2012-12-02,"Twilight, lowering the age of sexual maturity","This movie is definitely not for kids, if anybody had closely read the book (not too closely, might lose brain cells), Stephanie Meyers is continuously pushing the notation that ""sex before marriage while you are underage is okay""; the main character Bella is constantly trying to get into Edward's pants the whole series, but the only reason she doesn't is because she respects Edward's choice to get married first (what a saint, pedophilia and statutory rape averted). And what's with Jacob? The only nice guy in the entire book and movie that is trying to woo Bella, and not being a total jerk, but you know the saying: ""Nice guys finish last""; it's only in the second half of the movie that Jacob finds true love...with a baby. 
As time goes by books and movies are getting more and more connotative towards sex, drugs, and rock and roll (don't tell me you don't notice the psychedelic euphoria the vampires go through after tasting a tiny bit of human blood), while plot holes just keep multiplying and growing (was I the only one who noticed Edward's special ability to sparkle in the daylight suddenly disappeared between the second and third book/movie?). This movement is definitely an age gap problem; when I was younger I loved Harry Potter, but now that I am older and much more educated in literature and subliminal media, I realize that Harry Potter is only slightly better than Twilight. The only difference is that directors tried much harder in the HP movies than the Twilight movies.
If you have any problem with this review, look it up on the web before you decide that I am crazy for not loving a boring, bland, mentally-crooked, teenage girl for turning down a really nice, down-to-earth, half wolf-half body builder for a depressed, psycho-maniac, that spends half his time softly singing lullabies and killing wood-land critters for food.

114,Twilight,2012-01-07,A lesson in what not to do AKA Fantasy Romance done WRONG.,"While lauded by many a fangirl, this movie is rather questionable as a show for any immature person to watch. The romance in Twilight is decidedly unrealistic and sends a bad message to the audience - where if a boy likes you he is expected to be allowed access to your room at all hours (seeing Edward unknowingly watching her as she slept sent shivers down my spine - it's quite stalkerish in behaviour), that the girl can just toss aside her friendships for a boy that she only just met, that only the rich, handsome boys have a chance, that killing is alright if it's the bad guy that dies, wanting to end your life to be with the one you 'love' - et cetera. And this is just the first movie! 
Let's not mention that in the rest of the series there's unrealistic love triangles, suicide attempts (yes, more than one), unhealthy relationships, a lot of supernatural activity, violence galore, no responsibility for your actions, mentions of rape, sexual mentions, an horrific childbirth, 'ownership' of others, 'mild peadophilia' (Bella and Edward's child - who is a baby at the time - is bonded by Edward's rival for Bella's affections - Jake. This bond means that he is her 'guardian' with the intent to marry her when she's grown up - though apparently it's all up to her whether she wants it or not, but being brought up with the expectation would be hell on a childs psyche), subversion of major mythology (sparkling vampires? Try explaining that to any child with half a mind), people being eaten by vampires and major unrealistic expectations of female roles... just to name a few.

To think that this is a good show for anyone whose mind is still developing and finding themselves is pure madness. The shallow characters show no actual emotions, and express their so-called love with a coldness that stuns. Add in the subversive themes of male dominance and lack of strength of any kind in the main female lead and you have a film that undermines many other more progressive shows with its pure blandness.

I will admit that there are some good characters in the movie - Bella's father and the vampiress Alice among them, but alas, they are not enough to save this sham of a 'love story' from all its faults.Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff']",3,Adult,Unk,13,15,1

However, the acting is so unconvincing and flat that it affects my opinion of this film. The lead actors are the worst ones anywhere. Yes, Bella is supposed to be sour and insecure but with more than one facial expression. Script is not the best it could have been, either.

Better to read a book together, or go to a movie, and then discuss the issues afterwards--you can use those times as a teaching moment.

It has a very bloody, intense scene in a ballet studio in which bad vampire James tries to kill Bella. James is shown breaking her leg which makes a sharp crack that might be repulsive for some. Bella is shown being slammed into a wall which blood then spurts as she screams in pain. She also has to pull glass out of leg and hand which is disgusting and bloody. Edward and James fight but no blood. Alice rips off James's head. For sexuality Edward and Bella share a VERY passionate kiss moving together on a bed during which Bella wears very short shorts that may be considered underwear. Edward stops himself after about a minute. There are also several fun scenes in the movie. I would recommend it for 11+ though I'm sure younger have seen it too. People who like the movie may be drawn to the actors. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are NOT good role models. they both smoke and Kristen has been reported smoking pot.

149,Twilight,2009-10-13,Messages you don't want to send your kids.,"One issue I have with the Twilight movie and the books in general is that Bella doesn't seem reasonable at all. Her judgement is lacking severely, and she puts herself in danger and just does what she wants without thinking of the consequences. Furthermore she does all this for a boy. 

Would you want your daughter running off in the middle of the night if she new her boyfriend was about to do something potentially dangerous? Would you want her thinking its o.k. to obsess over her boyfriend to the levels that Bella does? would you want her thinking that its ok to let her boyfriend come into her room at night? 

Bella is far to dependent on Edward that she literally seems to have problems with her daily life because of it.  No part of her resembles a role model, and her actions send wrong messages. Like lying to your parents to protect your boyfriend. 

The Family values you get from the vampire family are good. This is a small saving grace. It would have been better had Bella's own family been that dependable, and if Bella would have trusted her own family that much.Show less",['Sexy stuff'],3,Adult,Unk,13,13,3

The scene in the bedroom when Bella was in her underwear was inappropriate and if I had a teenage daughter I wouldn't want her thinking that was okay.

Anyone who knows the book will know how that's going to turn out.

There are elements of Edward's obsession although they can be played off as part of the vampire lore.

The movie lacked some vampire-ness and it focuses more on Bella Swan's desperate need and love for Edward, and I think that's fine, but not enough to make a fantastic movie.

I understand love and I understand teenage emotions, but I don't think a young girl reading the story, forming her impressions, thoughts, and ideals about dating and men, would be positively influenced by Bella's choices.  Because in truth, regular boys are not immortal and not ever worth giving up your innocence, your faith, or certainly your life.

198,Twilight,2009-01-13,Parents need to know their kids for both the books & films,"As a vampire fan from way back, and after hearing my 13 yo son talk about how the girls in his class were all about the movie, I was intrigued with the Twilight series and bought the first book to read before I saw the movie. It's an easy read -- not like the Harry Potter series where you have to learn a whole new vocab. To me, it also read like a classic romance, i.e., Romeo and Juliet, Jane Eyre, where things like age aren't taken into consideration as much as they are today as much as maturity of the characters.

I saw the movie over the Christmas holiday when my sister was visiting from Miami. Her dh and my son declined the privelege and sought another movie in the cineplex. We both loved it. I agree with one other reviewer that Bella was a little too naked in her bedroom. The book always describes her as in her sweats or in pajamas that I always took to me she was decently covered. I also agree with the reviewer who said in the movie the kissing was more intense than in the book. Edward is much more controlled and a gentleman in the books.

This first movie is more than appropriate for 13 year olds. I don't think I'd take a child younger than that only because girls these days get so much boy/girl stuff thrown at them as it is. That being said, I have also read the rest of the series and while Stephanie Meyers does an admirable job of keeping the romance and sexual tension at a young adult level ***SPOILER ALERT*** until Bella and Edward get married, once they are, there are several, while not explicitly graphic sexual scenes, ones that as a parent I don't necessarily think are appropriate for 13-14 yo's. So I don't know if I would let my daughters read all the books until they were older. Maybe. They are only 5 and 6 right now. I don't know what their maturity level is going to be when they get there. I am very curious to see how all the books play out as screenplays.

Native Americans who refuse to allow the Collins family onto their reservation, three vampires who drink human blood (the Collins only eat animals) and start a bloody rampage, Bella’s schoolmates and then environmental factors the small town dynamic and peer pressure. Now all you have to do is throw in cupid, amazing special effect and artistic filming and you should be able to get the picture.  The movie is a refreshing twist on the old vampire tales.

The love scenes were perfect.  The acting by Kristen and Rob were stellar.  The movie was in motion none stop, and my friend who came who didn't read the books didn't realize it was a two hour movie.  She barely registered how involved she was in the movie.  She was as wrapped up as all of us twilight fans.  She really liked the movie and stated she would see it again.

I really liked it.  I realize the movie wasn't anticipate to be such a huge hit so their budge was small and for really a B budget film, they didn't a wonderful job.  I can't wait to see what they'll do for the second with a larger budget.

I would recommend it to all viewers.  I think it's hard for people to think of two people are are scared, in love, vulnerable and just so innocence.

235,Twilight: New Moon,2020-11-03,Wait--what? People are upset??,"Ahh, what a fickle bunch Twilight fans are. I remember the release of the first film last year, and the incredible backlash from fans of the series--can't even remember the number of comments saying ""Stick to the book!"" Incredible liberties were taken with the plot (or did we all forget the butchering of the much-beloved meadow scene in the first movie?), and too much of Hardwicke's own film-making style was imposed upon a story that was not hers to fiddle with.

Then New Moon comes out. Obviously, the screenwriter and director went to great lengths to painstakingly recreate the second book in film form, undoubtedly due to the response to Twilight. I am hard-pressed to think of any really pivotal plot points that were excluded from this film (and, no, the flights to and from Italy don't qualify as ""pivotal""). But suddenly fans come out in droves to complain on the Internet that the dialogue is cheesy? Hello, have you READ the books? Any actor is going to choke on the ridiculous dialogue that Stephenie Meyer came up with (I doubt even Robert De Niro could sell that tripe). Her dialogue only sounds remotely reasonable on the page. At least this movie didn't include such horrendous lines as ""I hated you for making me want you so much""). And people saying it's slow? Again, take a look at the book--the vast majority of the story is devoted to Bella moping over the imaginary hole in her chest. It wasn't exactly an action-packed thrill ride.

I for one thought this movie was a vast improvement over the first, primarily because it stayed so true to the book. And Weitz, unlike Hardwicke, wasn't itching to impose his own style on the story by using crazy camera angles and other weird stylistic elements that were nowhere suggested in the pages of Twilight. New Moon was fittingly glossy and stylistically neutral, appealing to a wider range of tastes. It was filmed beautifully and, to my great relief, had a much wider color palette than the first film.

As for the acting--let's face it, Kristen's never going to be an impressive performer until she realizes that scoffing doesn't qualify as ""emoting."" And Rob just seems flat-out wrong for this role, but I think he did tap into Edward's inner turmoil better than in Twilight. I thought the performances were, overall, a huge improvement over the first film, especially from Taylor, who fits the sunshiney role of Jacob to a T. The Cullens were, yes, sadly underutilized, but making the movie longer just to give them more screen time isn't going to appease complaints about it being boring and slow as it is.

Hopefully this film will get the credit it deserves after the initial tsunami of unreasonable outrage. It's obvious that the filmmakers are trying incredibly hard to please the fans of the book by staying closer to the text. Here's hoping they don't throw up their hands in frustration upon discovering that loyalty to the book is apparently not good enough either.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models', 'Sexy stuff']",3,Adult,Unk,13,18,5

238,Twilight: New Moon,2010-09-04,A teachable moment courtesy of Twilight: New Moon,"I watched the movie by myself on a Friday night. I made the decision that it was okay for MY 9-year-old daughter. My advice is to preview any movie you're unsure of yourself. What is okay for MY 9-year-old might not be okay for yours, and vice-versa. To me, it's just part of being ""Dad.""

On the way home from the theatre the next night, I had an awesome opportunity to point out a positive message of the movie.

For the purposes of our discussion we agreed that in this movie there are certian facts:
1. Vampires kill and eat humans.
2. Werewolves kill vampires to protect humans.
3. The Cullens are a family of vampires.
4. The Cullens do NOT kill and eat humans.

The language that Jacob and the rest of the ""pack"" uses paints the Cullens with a wide brush. The general theme is along the lines of ""It's only a matter of time until one of them loses control and kills Bella; there no such thing as a good vampire; they're all the same; know one vampire, and you know them all.""

I used this opportunity to teach my daughter that stereotyping ANY group is wrong, and that good and bad indiviuals are present in any group.

The Cullens are vampires. They do not kill humans. Not all vampires are the same. After agreeing that the author knows there is no such thing as vampires, I asked my daughter what she thought the author was trying to say. 

All vampires are not the same. Now substitue any group for ""vampires"" in that sentence.

Not all Irish people are the same.
Not all African Americans are the same.
Not all Italians are the same.
Not all Asians are the same. 
Not all Jews are the same.
Not all Muslims are the same.
Not all hispanics are the same.

I could go on, but I think I made my point. We talked about the lesson to be learned is to not pre-judge, to avoid stereotyping, and to take everyone we meet  as an individual person-- not part of a generalized whole.Show less",['Positive Messages'],3,Parent of a 10-year-old,10,13,9,4

271,Twilight: New Moon,2009-11-21,"OK for highschoolers, parental supervision recommended for tweens","I was generally pretty neutral about the movie.  While I enjoyed it better than the first installment of the Twilight Saga, the same pitfalls from the first movie came back to haunt the second.  Personally, I found the acting by Bella and Edward to be extremely poor, and the supposedly emotionally-charged moments between Bella and Edward, Bella and Jacob, and Edward and Jacob simply didn't have much oomph to them. I did tire of the audience of tween girls oohing and aahing every time Jacob took off his shirt--even showed up, and there was a lot more blood/wounds/etc. in this installment.  The director also added/changed a few scenes, which I liked, but I might be biased seeing how I am a college-age guy.Show less",['Violence & scariness'],3,Adult,Unk,13,15,3

As a parent I would not allow my daughter (8) to watch or read these books/movies until at least age 16. I think there is too much sexual inuendo, especially so knowing what comes in future books.

274,Twilight: New Moon,2009-11-21,"Good for most people over 13, USE A LOT OF CAUTION!!!!!","Well as a dedicated twilight fan I went to see the midnight opening showing with my 15 year old younger sister. I thought the movie was done well however I don't think that this movie is appropriate at ALL for any young teens(especially girls) I think the rating PG-13 should be taken HIGHLY serious. After Edward leaves Bella she stoops in to a 3 MONTH depression and keeps doing very dangerous(as well as very stupid) stunts to try and see Edward in her mind(which only occurs when she gets an adrenaline rush) She plays around with Jacob's(the other main guy) emotions in order to get what she wants, she even states to him that she is acting that way towards him for selfish reasons. For an 18yr old girl to be stooping in to a 3 month depression, throwing herself of cliffs, jumping and leaving on a motorcycle with a much older man who is a stranger who is looking for a ""good time"", driving fast on a motorcycle and getting thrown off all because of a guy is NOT a message that should be conveyed to young teen girls that are obsessed with the twilight craze. This movie also has MUCH more violence than the original twilight. There is a scene where a group of tourists get led in to a room of vampires(including very little children) and we hear screaming as they are being killed and eaten. We also see a group of vampires literally rip anothers limbs off. As someone who is able to stomach A LOT in movies, some of the scenes made me feel sick. I DO NOT RECCOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ANYONE UNDER 13, EVEN IF THEY BEG TO SEE IT!!!!!

by tarasabode
Of course New Moon will not win any Academy Awards but it was MUCH more professional a film than Twilight. The CGI was on a much higher scale, the acting stepped up a notch and most importantly, they stayed true to the novel itself. Let's not forget where this story came from..the imaginations of a mother of three who desired to recreate a dream and put it onto paper. If the critics are not supportive of this film, then the true fans will be. Anyone who has read the books could tell you that this is the second act of a four act play. It does not have the nice resolution or even the initial sensuality that the first part of the story brings forth. But what it does have is a good translation of print to screen. The acting is honestly fair to good among the three leads but perhaps this is simply a translation of the angst and depression necessary in this second act. Acting performances by Billy Burke, Dakota Fanning and Michael Sheen make this film worth seeing even for non fans.Show less",,3,Parent of a 8 and 11-year-old,811,13,12,4
276,Twilight: New Moon,2009-11-20,"A moony vampire teen romance, just for fun","This is a fun film to see with a bunch of other Twilight fans, no matter what the age.  The film follows the book pretty faithfully, but it helps to have read this book because there's a lot that's left out.  The photography is more dreamy.  The actors have improved.  Since it mainly takes place in Forks, the movie feels dark.  Almost a relief to get to Italy. Yes, there's violence.  The early scene of a vampire being killed is the most gruesome.  A good guy dies because of the vampire Victoria.  Bella becomes a thrill seeker, nearly killing herself, in an effort to have Edward near her.  The werewolves are thrilling, but not that scary after awhile.  As a previous viewer notes, Bella does sometimes make bad choices.  She's somewhat independent, and once she makes her mind up, she sticks with her decision.  I think her behavior is worth discussing with a teenager.  Yes, loosing a boyfriend is bad and can be depressing.  But you can overcome that, too.  I like the way her friends, of all sorts, try to help her. My personal peeve is the weird way Kristen Stewart talks, sort of out of the corner of her mouth and rather affected.  It's a lite vampire romp, enjoy it for what it is.Show less",['Consumerism'],3,Parent of a 10-year-old,10,13,9,4
277,Twilight: New Moon,2009-11-20,... Definitely an Improvement.,"I thought this second installment was okay. The acting was most certainly improved, and the direction was more notable and not laughable like last time. Although, something just didn't fell right about it. I believe the pace was off. PARENTS: there is more scary action than last time, but still not a huge amount (maybe three or four fantasy fights). There is also great passion, which could be considered sexual (although there are no sex scenes or nudity, except a lot of shirtless guys). Werewolves are abound, biting and eating, but nothing too gory. There is a rather intense vampire fight near the beginning and near the end. So, overall, this was an improvement, and hopefully someday they'll get it right. Thanks for reading - Movie ManShow less","['Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff']",3,Adult,Unk,13,12,3

Many teens feel ugly and depressed and maybe the author intended for the obvious contradiction of what Bella thinks of herself and what we see and know (beauty and good grades) to imply that perhaps they are not so ugly and stupid either.

King James Version Holy Bible
6 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.

7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.

8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.

9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

10 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
Philippians 3:18-20
King James Version
18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:

19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)

20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:2 Corinthians 4:8-18
King James Version
8 We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;

9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;

10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.

11 For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you.

13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;

14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present us with you.

15 For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.

16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.

17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;

18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
2 Timothy 2:23-26
King James Version
23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.

24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,

25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;

26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.2 Timothy 2:16-18

King James Version
16 But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.

17 And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;

18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.1 Timothy 6:20-21

20 O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:

21 Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.

King James Version
3 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.

2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.

3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

King James Version
5 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.

2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.

3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,

4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,

5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.

6 Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?

7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:

8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:

10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.

11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolator, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.

12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?

13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.2 Peter 2:1-3
King James Version
2 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.

2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.

3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.

10 I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. i obey god forever rather than man and im separate from you because your a unbeliever and your a unclean person and im separate from sinners and the world and i will never be unequally yoked together with you and with doctors and the bowen center because righteousness and unrighteousness are opposites just as light and darkness are opposites and have nothing in common wherefore i come out from among you and doctors and the bowen center and i touch not the unclean thing and i have no fellowship with you and doctors and the bowen center but rather i reprove you with gods words i expose your sins like god wants me to and i will never be a friend of this world and i serve jesus christ forever 5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. 6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them. 8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light: 9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;) 10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. 11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. 12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret. 13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light. 14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. 15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Ephesians 5:5-14 KJV Bible 2 Corinthians 6:17 17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you. 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. Galatians 5:19-26 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. 2 Corinthians 6:14 14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? Revelation 21:8 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. 9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife. 10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God,Matthew 10:28 28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Philippians 2:5-11 5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.Romans 12:2 2 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.Hebrews 9:27 King James Version Bible And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Matthew 12:36But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. Matthew 12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned john 5:24 King James Version Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.Romans 8 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God. 9 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it. Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. 4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? 5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. Luke 13:3-5 King James Version 2 Corinthians 7:10 King James Version 10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death. Acts 17:30-31 King James Version 30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: 31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. John 8:24 King James Version 24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.Colossians 3:5-11 King James Version 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry: 6 For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience: 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth. 9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; 10 And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him: 11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.

I believe not every spirit i try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby i know the spirit of God and every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses Jesus christ is not come in the flesh is not of God and this is that spirit of antichrist who is already in the world and i am of God and overcome them because greater is he who is in me than he who is in the world and they are of the world therefore they speak of the world and the world hears them im of God and know God and hear God he that is not of God hears not us hereby i know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error and i trust alone in jesus forever and i trust no one in this world and a true believers life is a changed life you will become a new creature in jesus christ old things pass away behold all things are become new and you will have a new heart with new desires new behavior you will talk differently and you will have a new life in jesus christ and you will have love for god and others and for gods words and jesus came not to send peace but a sword a separation between families because of their unbelief in Jesus Christ and my mom is a enemy in my own household because of her unbelief in Jesus Christ and jesus said so and she is a wolf come in sheeps clothing inwardly she is a ravening wolf and has a sinful anger and sinful anger is bad fruit and i know her by her fruits by what she says and by her behavior and actions just like jesus said in the bible and Jesus calls me a good tree i cannot bring forth evil fruit.Matthew 7:15-20

King James Version

15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

Matthew 10:34-36

King James Version

34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

36 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

4 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.

2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:

3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.

4 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.

5 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.

6 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.

7 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.

10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.

12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

13 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.

14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.

15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.

16 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

17 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.

18 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.

19 We love him, because he first loved us.

20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

21 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. matthew 25 kjv

Sodom &amp; Gomorrah: Example of Judgment
Sodom &amp; Gomorrah
Example of Judgment to Come
​

Location


1. Sodom and Gomorrah are located around the eastern side of the Dead Sea.



2. Gomorrah is located at the base of Masada, and Sodom is about 13 miles (20 km.) south of Gomorrah.



3. Though the actual locations of the cities are somewhat disputed, the growing evidence reveals that the locations are quite certain. This evidence is provided in the following section.



Historical Background


1. Josephus, a historian writer during the time of Christ, said the ruins could still be clearly seen in his day.



2. Archeologists have discovered around 1.5 million bodies in graves in these areas around Sodom and Gomorrah.



3. There are a lot of brimstone (old name for sulfur) balls in these cities.



4. This sulfur is unique and different from all other sulfur found in the world. 



It is around 90-95% pure.



It is white, unlike any other place in the world.



It is so pure you can light it on fire, and it burns a hot blue flame.



These sulfur balls are not found between the cities.



5. There is a lot of ash in these areas which fits the biblical narrative.
2 Peter 2:6: And if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter.



6. The material of these city formations is calcium sulfate, which is what limestone and sulfur become when heated. 



7. The choice building material in Israel is limestone, so these cities fit the scientific evidence as well.



8. There is a lot of charcoal layers found in the strata of these cities.



9. The amount of ash, charcoal, and calcium sulfate reveal overwhelming evidence of extreme heat in these cities.



10. There is also no geothermal activity in these areas to explain the ash, charcoal, and calcium sulfate.



11. In addition, there are many unexplained shapes in these areas that look like buildings, Sphinxes, pyramids, and palaces.



12. These cities existed around 4,000 years ago, so their remains would be difficult to distinguish. Plus, God destroyed and reduced them to ashes as well.



13. These cities fit the location as described in the Bible.
Genesis 13:10: Lot lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere—this was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah—like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt as you go to Zoar [Zoar has been identified as being south of Sodom and Gomorrah].

​

14. Because the Dead Sea basin used to be like the Garden of Eden, it was an extremely desirable climate that was great for agriculture and life in general. It was, therefore, a very populated area.



15. The thought of God raining down fire and brimstone upon the cities and peoples in this area is staggering and gives me chills up and down my spine. This fire and brimstone were so hot and intense it destroyed everything in its wake.

​

16. God also used Sodom and Gomorrah to refer to all of the cities of the Dead Sea basin.

Sodom and Gomorrah in the Bible


1. God told Abraham through two angels about His plan to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah.
Genesis 18:20–21: And the Lord said, “The outcry of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. 21 I will go down now and see if they have done entirely according to its outcry, which has come to Me; and if not, I will know.”



2. During a dialogue between Abraham and God, Abraham pleaded with God to spare the cities on account of the righteous ones living in them (Gen. 18:22–31).



3. God told Abraham that He would spare the cities if only 10 righteous people could be found in them. 
Genesis 18:32-33: And He said, “I will not destroy it on account of the ten.” 33 As soon as He had finished speaking to Abraham the Lord departed, and Abraham returned to his place.



4. In the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah lived hundreds of thousands of people. The fact that there were not even 10 righteous people speaks of the extreme wickedness of these cities.
Genesis 13:13: Now the men of Sodom were wicked exceedingly and sinners against the Lord.



5. The wickedness of Sodom revealed.
Genesis 19:1–11: Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. 2 And he said, “Now behold, my lords, please turn aside into your servant’s house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may rise early and go on your way.” They said however, “No, but we shall spend the night in the square.” 3 Yet he urged them strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 4 Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter; 5 and they called to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them.” 6 But Lot went out to them at the doorway, and shut the door behind him, 7 and said, “Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly. 8 Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man; please let me bring them out to you, and do to them whatever you like; only do nothing to these men, inasmuch as they have come under the shelter of my roof.” 9 But they said, “Stand aside.” Furthermore, they said, “This one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge; now we will treat you worse than them.” So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door. 10 But the men [two angels] reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them, and shut the door. 11 They struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway.



6. God warns Lot and his family to flee for their lives.
Genesis 19:12–17: Then the two men said to Lot, “Whom else have you here? A son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and whomever you have in the city, bring them out of the place; 13 for we are about to destroy this place, because their outcry has become so great before the Lord that the Lord has sent us to destroy it.” 14 Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, “Up, get out of this place, for the Lord will destroy the city.” But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be jesting. 15 When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” 16 But he hesitated. So the men seized his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, for the compassion of the Lord was upon him; and they brought him out, and put him outside the city. 17 When they had brought them outside, one [angel] said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stay anywhere in the valley; escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away.”



7. God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah.
Genesis 19:23–29: The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar [located south of Sodom and Gomorrah]. 24 Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven, 25 and He overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. 26 But his wife, from behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. 27 Now Abraham arose early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before the Lord; 28 and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley, and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land ascended like the smoke of a furnace. 29 Thus, it came about, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.



God used Sodom and Gomorrah as examples of judgment upon the ungodly throughout the Bible.


1. Moses used Sodom and Gomorrah as warnings for the future generations of the Israelites.
Deuteronomy 29:23: All its land is brimstone and salt, a burning waste, unsown and unproductive, and no grass grows in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in His anger and in His wrath.



God specifically states that He destroyed two other cities besides Sodom and Gomorrah (Adman and Zeboiim). However, it appears He also destroyed Zoar because after Lot left Zoar his two daughters said there was no one in the land for them to marry.



2. The prophets continually used Sodom and Gomorrah as examples of God’s wrath on the ungodly. 
Jeremiah 49:18: Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah with its neighbors,” says the Lord, “no one will live there, nor will a son of man reside in it.”



Lamentations 4:6: For the iniquity of the daughter of my people Is greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were turned toward her.



3. Jesus used Sodom and Gomorrah as examples of God’s judgment on the ungodly.
Luke 17:28–30: It was the same as happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building; but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. It will be just the same on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.



4. The Apostles used Sodom and Gomorrah as examples of God’s coming judgment on the ungodly.
2 Peter 2:4–10: For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment; and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter; and if He rescued righteous Lot, oppressed by the sensual conduct of unprincipled men (for by what he saw and heard that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds), then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment, and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt desires and despise authority.



Jude 1:5–7: Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day— 7 just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.



Repeatedly, throughout the accounts of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the sin of homosexuality is highlighted as the main wickedness for which God destroyed them.



Some, who defend homosexuality, claim that God destroyed them because of their lack of hospitality. 



5. God uses the same imagery of fire and brimstone in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah as for what hell will be like.
Revelation 20:10: And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.



Faith Lesson from Sodom and Gomorrah


1. The lesson from Sodom and Gomorrah is a serious, sobering message we should allow to sink in deeply.



2. The primary sin for which God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah was homosexuality. However, they sinned in many other ways as well.



3. Sodom and Gomorrah are a foreshadow of what hell will be like.



4. Jesus talked about how His second coming would be like that of Sodom and Gomorrah. Jesus also spoke more about hell than heaven. 



5. If God, the prophets, Christ, and the apostles used Sodom and Gomorrah as an example of the eternal judgment in hell that awaits the ungodly, then we should do the same today as well.



6. God is a God of love and has done everything He can to save us, but for those who reject His offer of salvation, eternal suffering in the Lake of Fire awaits them (Rev. 20:10).
2 Peter 2:6

King James Version

6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly; 2 Chronicles 7:14

King James Version

14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Isaiah 55:6-9

King James Version

6 Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:

7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.

9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. you can make your thoughts be gods thoughts and his ways be your ways if you let his thoughts be your thoughts and his ways be your ways and god will make his ways be your ways and thoughts be your thoughts by the power of the holy spirit in you and by his words.

King James Version

4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.Jude 7
King James Version
7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.Genesis 19
King James Version
19 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:

5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.

6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,

7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.

11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:

13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.

14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.

15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.

17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:

19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:

20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.

21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.

22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

24 Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;

25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord:

28 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

29 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.

30 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

31 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:

32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

33 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

34 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

35 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.

37 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

38 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.Sodom’s evils described

From the creation, Paul explained, mankind quickly began drifting away from God’s ways (Romans 1:20-25). As mankind went astray, men and women began to exchange the wholesome, God-ordained use of sex for vile and shameful passions (verses 26-27). Paul also listed a number of other sinful behaviors that humans began practicing as they turned from God (verses 28-31).

Likewise addressing sexual immorality, the apostle Jude said that Sodom and Gomorrah, “having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire” (Jude 1:7).

What Jude called “strange flesh” (“unnatural lust,” Revised Standard Version) is often called “alternative lifestyles” in our modern age. The term sounds so innocent in our culture, but this denotes sexual behavior that is unnatural and offensive to God (Barnes’ Notes on the Bible, Jude 1:7).

When we read Genesis 19:1-8, it becomes easy to see that this is what both Paul and Jude had in mind. Sodom’s society was steeped in widespread sexual immorality, including homosexual acts and vicious rapes (verses 4-5). The residents of Sodom had become so evil that God could not find even 10 righteous people among them (Genesis 18:32).

More sins of Sodom

In the book of Ezekiel, God listed some of the other sins of Sodom in the context of showing how Judah had become much like Sodom. God told Judah, “Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they [the Sodomites] were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit” (Ezekiel 16:49-50).

God also compared the Jewish religious leaders in Jerusalem with the people of Sodom. “They commit adultery and walk in lies; they also strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns back from his wickedness. All of them are like Sodom to Me, and her inhabitants like Gomorrah” (Jeremiah 23:14).

When the leadership of a society doesn’t set a good moral example and evil is allowed to flourish, the population will generally decline toward the same bad behavior (Ecclesiastes 8:11). To learn more about the similar societal conditions before the Flood in Noah’s day, read “As in the Days of Noah.”

Isaiah 13
King James Version
13 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

2 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.

3 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.

4 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

5 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the Lord, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.

6 Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.

7 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:

8 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.

9 Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.

10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

11 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.

13 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

14 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.

15 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

18 Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children.

19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

21 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

22 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
Psalm 46
King James Version
46 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.

2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.

6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.

7 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.

8 Come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.

9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.

10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

11 The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.Hebrews 12:6-8
King James VersionHebrews 12:26-29
King James Version
26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.

27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:

29 For our God is a consuming fire.Leviticus 20
King James Version
20 And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

2 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.

3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:

5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.

7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the Lord your God.

8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the Lord which sanctify you.

9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.

10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

11 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.

13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.

15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.

16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.

19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.

21 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.

22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.

23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.

24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the Lord your God, which have separated you from other people.

25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.

26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the Lord am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.Ephesians 5
King James Version
5 Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;

2 And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.

3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;

4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.

5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.

6 Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.

7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.

8 For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:

9 (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)

10 Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.

11 And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.

12 For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.

13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.

14 Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.

15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,

16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.

17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.

18 And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;

19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;

20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;

21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.

23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.

24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.

25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;

26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,

27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.

28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.

29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:

30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.

31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.

32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.

33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
Ephesians 2:2-4
King James Version
2 Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:

3 Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.

4 But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,
Colossians 1
King James Version
1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,

2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,

4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,

5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;

6 Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:

7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;

8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.

9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;

10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;

11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;

12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:

13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:

14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:

15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:

16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:

17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.

18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.

19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;

20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.

21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:

23 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;

24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:

25 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;

26 Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:

27 To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:

28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:

29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.Ephesians 1:13-14
King James Version
13 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,

14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.Bible Verses About Sodom

King James Version
5 For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:

3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.

4 For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.

6 Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:

7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

8 We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.

10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.

11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.

12 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.

13 For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.

14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:

15 And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.

16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.

17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

18 And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;

19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.

21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.Romans 1
King James Version
1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,

2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)

3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;

4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:

5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:

6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:

7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.

9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;

10 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.

11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;

12 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.

13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.

15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.

16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.

17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.

18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;

19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,

23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:

25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:

27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.

28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:

32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.Bible Verses About HomosexualityBible verses related to Homosexuality from the King James Version (KJV) by Relevance

Genesis 19

King James Version

19 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

2 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

3 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:

5 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.

6 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,

7 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

8 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

9 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

10 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.

11 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.

12 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:

13 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord; and the Lord hath sent us to destroy it.

14 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.

15 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

16 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the Lord being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.

17 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.

18 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord:

19 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:

20 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.

21 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.

22 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.

23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

24 Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven;

25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.

26 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.

27 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord:

14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. Isaiah 55:6-9

King James Version

6 Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near:

7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

8 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.

9 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. you can make your thoughts be gods thoughts and his ways be your ways if you let his thoughts be your thoughts and his ways be your ways and god will make his ways be your ways and thoughts be your thoughts by the power of the holy spirit in you.
1 Corinthians 2
King James Version
2 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.

2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.

3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.

4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:

5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.

6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:

7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:

8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.

10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.

11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.

12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.

13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.

14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.

15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.

16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ.2 Peter 2:6

285,The Lizzie McGuire Movie,2009-01-26,"Farfetch'd, cheesy, and has nothing to do with the show","Lizzie McGuire was a sitcom about a 7th grade girl and her wacky adventures with her friends and family, relying mostly on silly slapstick for its humor, but still being a fairly enjoyable show. The Lizzie McGuire Movie, however, is completely different. Lizzie (Hilary Duff) is graduating middle school and the entire eighth grade is going to Rome (aren't these kinds of things for seniors in high school?). She is quickly spotted out in Italy by singer Paalo (Yani Gellman) as a look-a-like for his singing partner Isabella (also played by Duff). Isabella has left the music world, so Paalo says. Paalo asks Lizzie to pose as her so that he can make a comeback. She agrees while friends Kate (Ashlie Brillault) and Gordo (Adam Lamberg) cover for her to avoid Lizzie getting in trouble with trip leader and soon-to-be-her-principal Ms. Ungermeyer (Alex Borstein) for skipping tours of the city. This is a PG movie and thus fairly predictable, so I think it's safe to say that Lizzie fulfills her dreams of being a singer - which strangely, were never mentioned on the show - without getting in too much trouble.

Generally, this would be a pretty nice idea for a kids' movie. The problem is - this has little to do with the actual show. The show relied on wacky situations to advance its nearly nonexistent storyline. Because of this nonexistent storyline, anything was pretty much possible for the movie. But seriously, having a girl look exactly like you then posing to be her while on a class field trip in Rome so that you can be the world's next big celebrity? Wow, Disney.

This is the only movie I can watch two different ways.
One as an all out assault of sci-fi drama with solid action, amazing effects, beautiful people and cheesy nods to war propaganda of olde.
Two as a terrific commentary on society, loss of innocence, horror of war, personal and emotional upheaval, fascism, freedom, cost of glory. It’s a shopping list.
It’s fun and appeals to and indulges the little kid war fantasies - G.I Joe battles in the sandpit - but also the adult concepts of what war is.
By those points, if this was PG, or animated like Robotech, it would be a good gateway film for kids getting into more mature fare.

I probably wouldn’t recommend this to someone who wouldn’t watch it.

334,The Last Airbender,2019-01-28,Incredibly mediocre rendition of exceptional TV-Series.,"While I watched and loved the original cartoon when I was young, this movie adaptation just left me feeling frustrated. While it borrows many events and story beats from it's source material, it does pretty much all of it worse. It is family friendly, and there are some competent special effects and action scenes, but there really isn't anything here you're not getting a better version of from the show itself.

Violence: While the ""Bending"" Magic the characters employ is based off of martial arts, there are very few actual physical attacks. most of the time the characters just throw fire, water or air at their enemies which knocks them over. There is one fight scene where characters actually punch and tackle each other, but there's nothing exceptionally violent or painful looking in it.  Some battle scenes portray soldiers fighting with spears and swords. While we don't see any stabbing, you can still assume there were casualties given that it is an actual military conflict. There is one brief shot of a sword hitting someone on the shoulder, and no blood is drawn. Another scene depicts two motionless, and possibly dead soldiers tied against a wall. There is a scene where the main characters come across a field full of skeletons, and it is revealed it was the site of a genocide.  A child cries and screams in horror after learning that his family was part of the slaughter. While we are lead to believe that the main character doesn't kill anyone, he uses his wind powers to launch some of his foes so high into the air that it's hard to believe that they weren't at least crippled. In general, it is unclear if the injuries we see soldiers receive during the gestalt battle sequences are fatal. A man is kicked in the groin in one scene. A soldier is drowned with water magic.

Positive messages and role models: The film encourages the audience to accept the sadness in their lives instead of running away from their problems; ultimately claiming that if you try to suppress sadness, then it will lord over you and make your life harder, and you can only move on by accepting it, then looking forward. The casting is somewhat problematic. Despite the film being set in an Asian inspired universe, most main characters are white. The villains are all portrayed as being of Indian descent.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Violence & scariness']",2,Adult,Unk,9,7,2

337,The Last Airbender,2012-03-23,"Compared to the series, an epic disappointment","If you're a fan of the awesome Nick series, Avatar: The Last Airbender, DON'T see this movie.
I went in excited with high expectations for this live action rendition of the series, and like most other ATLA fans I know, I left the theater disappointed.
Much of the actual story was cut out, pieced together with events that didn't make sense, and new sequences were added that had nothing to do with the storyline. The actors, their attire, and even their locations looked nothing like they were portrayed in the series
The special effects were honestly the best part of the movie; it seems like 90% of the budget was spent on the effects, and 10% on actors and writing.

It's mind-boggling how writer-director Shyamalan, who once showed such promise, managed to butcher almost every element of character, story and mythology that made the show great.  I'm still furious about it. However, taken unto itself, the movie is -- to be honest -- just mediocre.  The dialog is dumb, the acting is wooden, and insight is non-existent. Still, it looks decent and has one or two action scenes that move along passably.  Kids under 10 might find some entertainment in it.  Other than a little stylized martial arts combat, there's very little in the movie that might upset anyone.  EXCEPT for the fact it's a dull, clunky hack-job on a great, great show.  Do yourself a favor: skip this movie and watch the first few episodes of the TV series.  If that doesn't hook you, then the story won't do it for you.

346,The Last Airbender,2010-07-21,Perfect for ages 8-14 who have also seen (and love) the cartoons of it.,"First off, I am a 17 year old who appreciates, nay enjoys, live action versions of cartoon series. This movie is more of an exception though. I really enjoyed the cartoons, but the movie was a bit stale in terms of acting. The SFX are gorgeous, but as for the martial arts, the fight scenes are a bit unrealistic, even for a kid's film. It is absoluetly PERFECT for young audiences. Those who have not seen the cartoons may not understand the movie as well as those who have, therefore I strongly reccomend that those who have not seen the cartoons rent Book 1: Water of The Last Airbender and watch it in full before watching this film. 


My only concern was the showing of broken skeletons at a temple where the Fire Nation wiped out a bunch of Air Nation monks. The cartoons were much less graphic, showing helmets and ruins; the movie is a bit more graphic. Not insane, mind you, but it may be a bit disturbing for those under the age of 10. There is also a scene were someone appears to die in the explosion of a ship, but you only see the explosion form the outside of the ship. It might shock younger viewers.

Children should be bored or terrified by the constantly dark and depressing settings in the film, the over-done battle sequences, and the lack of humor or light-heartedness (which the series had plenty of, mind you). Others should be completely confused by the plotline that was barely explained, disappointed by the lack of character development, irritated by the poor camera work and sometimes awkward special effects, and just plain unamused.

If you want your children to watch something and enjoy it, get them the DVDs of the animated series. It's far more child appropriate...

I was furious with the presentation and the lack of regard to the source material.  It insults the intelligence of my younger brother, and the devoted fan base.  On top of that stuff, which I could over look, it insults the cultural richness of the show.  It mocks real martial arts with lame line dance style kung fu, untalented extras with unintentionally hilarious faces, and a style of bending (ability to manipulate elements) which tells me that they were thinking ""let's show off our talented lead role's skills then actually put some special effects near the end of the sequence.""  The lead casting also ignores the fact that the characters are based off of asian and inuit influences.  It removes all of the spirit and charm of the show and turns it into a mostly boring, unintentionally humorous at times, and truly dark (especially at the end) film.

In regards to the dark reference.  I have no problem spoiling something: the review above was wrong.  ""There's one memorable death, but it's self-sacrificial and gently handled.""  That's true, one of the TWO deaths was handled correctly.  A primary, forward antagonist is also killed.  In the television show, this man's life is taken as an act by the ocean spirit.  In the movie, M. Night Shyamalan put in his own little touch of evil.  Four water benders walk onto the bridge and face the lone antagonist.  They lift up four streams of water and lift him up into the air encased in a bubble of water.  You see him struggle for a couple seconds, then go unconscious.

   The writers take all of Season 1: Water and condense it down to 1 hour 43 min.  This means they try to cover from discovering Aang frozen in the ice all the way to the battle to defend the Northern Water Tribe.  They try to include many important parts (Aang discovering the Air nomads were wiped out, Zukko's exile &amp; taking on the Blue Spirit persona..) but because this movie tries to cover way too much ground nothing is fully built up and none of the characters get fully fleshed out to the point that you care about them.  There is no banter (fun, joking talk) and their trip to the Northern tribe is relayed through short scenes with no adventures. 
  They do try to fill in the story line with some narrative by Katara and characters giving little pieces of back story about themselves.  Unfortunately, some of that seems forced, like ""oh, we've got to tell you this, so let's have this character say something.""
   The movie looks great visually and has a very racially diverse cast ( by the way, it is NEVER said in the animated series that ANY character is actually asian -- the fight style, artwork and spirit stories are asian inspired).  
   And as far as the special effects -- don't look for any quick fight scenes (and nothing is really scary).  All the bending is alot of motion and minimal special effects until Aang's final fight.

431,Mortal Kombat: The Movie,2020-12-14,Nostalgia about a great childhood game,"Sonia: ""A handful of people on a leaky boat are gonna save the world?"" 
Raiden : Exactly!

It is the adaptation of a violent fighting game. Of course. Violence is that thing our loved ones had to do in WWII at they 18's, so that you can surf the internet today peacefully while getting fat by eating fast foods. For those who like martial arts it is a full plate. Or for those who want to pursue a career as a fighter or a fighting teacher. Or just work as a physical educator. Because the Mortal Kombat game, as well as the movie, is for martial arts fans. For those who like sports. Mortal sports in this case, but I will explain it better. And martial arts is a career that your child can pursue. It is based on films like The Great White Dragon, Bruce Lee films and so far. Films where martial art is acclaimed. But in Mortal Kombat, fantasy adds color to the film. With sorcerer, gods, monsters and ninjas with magical powers from another world. So yes, it's a fantasy story. Intelligent children know how to distinguish reality from myths. Just like fictional violence, with violence in real life. The film does not set an example of gratuitous violence. The fight they have to face in the film comes from an alien attack, where they have to fight these invaders in a tournament to protect the Earth. So, it is not a film where violence is simply sadism, it is justified violence, self-defense. In which the one who has more wisdom and are more physical prepared in martial arts wins, in heads-up, in a tournament, to protect the Earth from the alien invaders. Every martial art teacher knows that there is a big difference between justified violence, to defend yourself, between gratuitous and sadistic violence, and the film sends that message. With the Earth's protectors.

461,Ghost Rider,2008-04-09,Luke Warm Acting,"I only tangentially know the Ghost Rider legacy, but the concept is very interesting. Thank god, however, that Nicholas Cage didn't get the Superman gig.
I found his acting very mediocre and not very inviting especially in the first third of the flick.  Eva Mendez was obviously chosen because she's a worse actress than Cage. And Peter Fonda, whose only ""hook"" to a movie like this is his Easy Rider legacy, is also poorly equipped for the big screen. Check out some of his acting since Easy Rider, such as ""Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry,"" and you can see why he isn't regularly offered acting roles. Stiff, to describe his acting, is a knock on Al Gore.  He's absolutely glacial in his approach to what could have been a wonderful small role.
The action carries the last two-thirds of the flick and I am sure appeals to bikers, with flaming tire marks and devastation. Sam Elliot seems to be a favorite for Marvel based movies and is above average as the caretaker. Though the box office doesn't lie, I was left wanting, mostly because of acting, but also for a failure to incorporated some powerful music, except when for the end when a contemporary version of the Vaughan Monroe classic, ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" was heard.

473,Scooby-Doo,2018-08-19,Uncomfortable... ,"The film itself isn't terribly good, but the casting of Shaggy, Scooby and Velma is pretty much spot on. It's not massively scary, but not recommended for very young children. However, it at times feels aimed more at teenagers than kids, and feels uncomfortable for a film based on a children's cartoon in a number of ways... 
1) The skimpy, tight, low cut, cleavage emphasising outfits on the women...Who is that aimed at?! 
2) Fred and Daphne switch bodies and Fred looks down at his new found breasts and states in a grossly perverted voice ""heeey, I can look at myself naked..."", while pulling his / her top open to sneak a peek. He then continues to rub his new female body, including some breast groping, while the real Daphne (in Fred's body) protests, telling him to stop touching her body, and Fred ignores her lack of consent.
3) Scrappy Doo tells Fred ""you don't have the scrote for this job"" and appears to grab his own crotch below camera and vaguely thrust as he says it. There's also a scene where Fred jokes to Scooby something like ""this is more embarrassing than the time you were caught cleaning your beans"" in the middle of a party. 
4) There are a couple of drug references, including Fred freaking out at the situation he is in and telling Shaggy in a mock stoner voice he thinks someone spiked his drink, and begging Shaggy to ""talk me down, man. Talk me down"" from the high.
5) Daphne states she's going to open a can of ""whoop ass"", and Scrappy shouts ""I would have got away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling sons of..."" before being cut off just short of 'the B word"".  Fred at one point also uses the word ""b-yotch"", which is obviously the subtle form of 'the B word'.

After reading the CommonSense Media rating, I let my 8-year-old daughter watch the movie with her father because she likes Scooby-Doo. As only one other rater seemed to notice, there was a part where Fred and Daphne's bodies were switched. Fred, inside Daphne's body, said very happily/sexily: ""Hey, I can look at myself naked!"" while he (she) looked down and smiled at Daphne's breasts/cleavage. Then Daphne, in Fred's body, watched Fred (in her body) touch himself and said ""get your hands off me!"" but Fred was very disrespectful, wouldn't listen to her and kept touching her body (which he was in). Later she said ""Fred keeps touching me!"" There was also one subtle reference to drugs/being high that I noticed, when Fred's character says to Shaggy (in a paranoid voice like someone who is high and hallucinating), ""Listen Man, someone must've spiked my root beer last night!"" Then he assumes it's a bad trip and he's high and asks Shaggy to help him come down from his drug high he thinks he's on: ""Talk me down, man, talk me down""!Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff', 'Drinking, Drugs & Smoking']",3,Parent,Unk,10,12,1

506,Silent Hill,2013-04-19,Disappointing (and not scary!),"It took me a long time to finally see this movie as the description didn't really appeal to me. Well, I was right. I didn't enjoy it much at all. Even the beginning was dull and slow moving. I have to agree with CommonSense that it is very grim, violent and certainly not for kids or younger teens. I couldn't get into the story so I ended up turning it off about 1 hour later. Language is strong. Violence is very gruesome and gory with lots of weird creatures throughout. I didn't notice any sexual content. I don't think any positive messages would exist in this movie. It is likely to scare teens and sensitive adults but I did not find anything scary about it half way through.

526,Resident Evil,2020-05-11,Mediocre Adaptation of a great Video Game Franchise,"As a big fan of the games this film is based off of, it was very disappointing. I'm 99% sure that the director of this film, Paul Anderson (yes I am gonna ignore the W.S. in his name) never played any of the games. Like, this film was released in 2002. By this time there were multiple games and books to at least inspire this film, but the only monsters they take from the franchise are generic zombies and badly animated CGI ""lickers"", in quotes because in this film the main kicker looks like absolute garbage. Also, Alice (Milla Jojovich) is the most bland, OP action movie protagonist of all time, which is a shame. Okay, enough fanboy whining. This movie is surprisingly tame in regards to violence, like a strong PG-13. There's a scene where Milla Jojovich awakes with amnesia in a shower, and you can see some side nipple. A very brief 2 second flashback where Alice is having sex with a man (no actual nudity seen, but bare backs and such). *SPOILER WARNING* In the end, Alice is half naked with just a white cloth covering her down to the thighs. If you slow down and pause the film at around 1:30:57 you can see some of Alice's..... crotchal re-- okay, I'll be blunt, you see her vagina. You have to look hard to see it though. Ah, I remember me and my friend would slow the footage down to see it back in the early 2000's. Infrequent swearing, maybe 4-5 F bombs.

-An older troll-horse ""dies"" and falls into a casket, then the singer closes the lid (he does come back later).
-The little worm ""dies"" and then is revived, but he is sad that he didn't stay dead because he thought he was at home.
-A jazz troll ""seduces"" the other trolls with his music which causes them to hallucinate strange things like eating sushi rolls of each other...it was really weird.

There are no Bergens in this movie, just a cameo at the end.   There are some mild perilous parts for the main characters, and the Rock-n-Roll trolls fly around in some scary shark-like backpacks destroying things.   However - it had less scary parts than the first troll movie - no actual death risk or trolls getting eaten.  Our 5 year old was not as scared with this one as the first (he was was on edge a lot for the first movie and really worried about trolls getting eaten or dying.).  We did watch the trailers a couple of times, which I think helped him through when the rock-n-roll trolls were slightly scary.

They could have skipped the love connection but it wasn't too much sexy stuff and our little one didn't get it.

Not a big thing - but there are two times that characters have gumdrops in their ears - curious if that will encourage kids to try it - but it wasn't overdone - just a heads up to other parents in case you have a little one who might try that :D

There was some mild language: ""we're screwed"" and ""you suck"" and the lead Rock-n-Roll Troll Queen says some pretty nasty things about the Techno and Pop trolls - but nothing so bad that we couldn't say - hmm, was that a nice thing to say?


Although it was a little hard to explain to our 5 year old why rock and roll wasn't ""bad"" (we went with ""the music is good, but  Queen Barb makes some bad choices because she wants everyone to be the same."")

Pop also gets a bad name in this movie... won't explain why without spoilers, but that was another one to explain.

But I have to admit the issue was resolved well, and it ended on a good message. And it was fun to see all the different troll worlds with their different music (the funk trolls were especially amazing). 

They did say ""you suck"" and ""we're screwed,"" which I don't particularly appreciate in a kids' movie. 

To those who were disturbed by Guy Diamond hatching a baby: How did you think trolls give birth? Male and female trolls look the same, so they're going to reproduce differently from humans. They're trolls, not humans. Even the fairies in Tinkerbell's universe are born differently (from a baby's sneeze) even though they look humanoid.

562,Trolls World Tour,2020-08-31,Fun Movie with Some Questionable Moments,"Overall the movie was a lot of fun. Great music fun and colorful. My three year old LOVES this movie because of the music and colors. It's Troll movie and it's DreamWorks, a large number of shenanigans is to be expected so I went in with an open mind. 

Once my toddler starts to recognize some of the ""hidden"" messages I'll have to have a chat with him about what is okay and what isn't. 

I do wish they'd had more techno, reggaeton and Kpop music (at least in the soundtrack - little disappointing) Seriously for a movie that is about music diversity there was less than 5 minutes of music dedicated to those three genres. The funk Trolls were AWESOME! Just throwing that out.

However, there are some parts that found inappropriate for a children's cartoon. 

1) Guy Diamond having a baby. They make this whole big deal out of it which frankly was really uncomfortable to watch.

2) Country Trolls singing ""Born to Die"", while I understand life is hard and things happen that doom and gloom isn't something I feel a toddler needs to understand yet. Plus during the scene a troll dies and drops into the coffin ...

3) Pop Mash Up - was hilarious and fun except for Biggie and booty shaking , buttcrack showing. 

4) The scene with smooth jazz and the hallucinations was a bit weird. Like tripping on something. Chaz licking the clarinet was ewwww.

5) Mr Dinkles tries to kill himself - I just can't this part

But the whole story idea of different musical 'threads' / genres was a bit difficult for the kids to follow (and me too) at first. For example we had no idea what those Techno troll fish were at the beginning or why the scary red trolls were threatening them. But over time we mostly figured out what was going on.

567,Trolls World Tour,2021-02-15,Bizarre. Not inappropriate but it’s a thin line.,"We found this movie to be a flop compared to the first one. 

The kids of course are drawn to the silliness (music and colors etc) but it’s so boring otherwise. 

It’s not inappropriate but I gave it the age rating I did because of some stuff that (mostly younger) kids will undoubtedly pick up on that probably rides a thin line for most parents. “You suck” “we’re screwed” “oh balls” etc

Although I don’t find these to be curse words in my house, they are rude given the age range this movie is directed at and we don’t encourage our kids to say these things.

I also found the boy troll “Guy Diamond” having a baby to be a little bit weird and unnecessary to the story. 

The movie has very little substance, it’s like a cheap rip off idea of Thanos trying to steal the stones.

The movie divides trolls supposedly by their music preference but you can't help but see by the voice and language to understand what is going on and that it's divided by race.  After the part about how pop music stole the string from the funk trolls and called it their own and oppressed the funk trolls or whatever my 3-year-old goes ""oh mommy were the white trolls bad to the black trolls"". Clearly the agenda was designed for young children as my kids picked it up before I did. I find it strange too that the villains in this movie like rock music and we are there for telling our children that people who like rock music are bad guys.  I love rock music, I'm a healthcare provider, And I come from a long line of veterans who like rock music.  This is a movie that belongs in russia or north korea.

What makes it great, is a much needed message of: we can all be different and create beauty and art - not despite our differences but because of them!
I personally think mildly “bad” language is something every kid will hear by the time they enter daycare/school. There’s nothing in the movie they haven’t been exposed to. 
I also believe there’s a lot of sadness and pain in our society that our kiddos pick up on. Those are portrayed in the movie. Emotions are real and their expressions are important to start healing. The more we normalize them, the easier it will be to talk about them. The more we talk about them, the more we heal.

That being said, it's kindof a cheesy movie version of the game that adds a plot and includes most of the characters I believe.  It has an interesting backstory/plot for the 'creation' of the character Blanka also.

I understand that the nudity is just of ducks, but being that they are humanoid, and they took out the time to create nipples on the breasts, it seems very inappropriate for children.  In addition to there being blatant alcoholism, cussing/profanity, there are two specific scenes that I didn't like my children seeing in the first 2 minutes.  In one, Howard opens a Playboy centerfold and looks longly (the camera zooms and freezes) on a nude duck, large DD breasts, and nipples, yes covered with feathers, but nipples?  Then within a few seconds, they show a female duck in a bath tub, large breasts, and larger brighter nipples.  Lastly, there is a scene, though they don't show nudity, but where Howard the duck screws a human, sleeps with her, and they even talk about having sex.  ""Once you go duck....""

Topless female duck early in the movie - I wouldn't care, except they linger on the shot for a rather long time, and they took the time to make the image rather humanoid and accurate.  Not for kids.
There's a ""Playduck"" magazine early in the show as well, nothing as bad as the toplessness I just mentioned, but also not for kids; at least not for mine.
There's an entire scene (several minutes) with partially clothed couples in private saunas doing things that make them moan suggestively... not for kids.
Throughout the movie, there is attempted sexual assault, lots of sexual situations, a condom is shown from Howard's wallet, and a girl in lingerie attempts to get Howard to use it at another point.

So, I agree that this movie is so bad it is mildly entertaining, but definitely for more mature high school kids and older; not for kids under 16 or so, I believe.

624,Howard the Duck,2016-05-02,Disappointing,"I set out to write this review as I found the other reviews on Common Sense Media lacking. I pulled this movie out of my collection because I have never seen it. My oldest child will be 13 this year and we are excited to introduce some of the PG &amp; PG-13 movies that we had restricted until our children were more mature, and Howard the Duck is one of them.

Five minutes into the movie I determined it isn't right for my children. The naked duck referenced in CSM's review is in a bathtub, it has a humanoid form and sports human nipples which are clearly visible. Before that we see the duck alternative of Playboy as Howard is looking through it, eventually unfolding the centerfold model.

Later in the movie the female main character finds an unwrapped condom in Howard's wallet while he is sleeping. I don't know if CSM messed up their review or if they were referencing a previous version of this movie, but at no point does a condom come into play during pseudo-sex scene.  Howard and the girl do not have sex, but there is a 2-3 minute scene featuring the two in bed. The girl is wearing lingerie and Howard makes an attempt to have sex with her. The girl responds positively, it eventually turns out that she was joking with him and nothing happens but this is still a problematic concept.

The ""sex spa"" comes off as more of a brothel and there are shots of women either completely naked or wearing ""barely there"" robes that JUST cover nipples. Overall I didn't think the movie was very good, it did pick-up in the second half when it reached its full cheesy glory.

I usually allow some sexual content to slide if the story contained is high quality or very culturally relevant, and, sadly, this movie is far from either of those. The bottom line rating for my family is 16+ on this one.Show less",['Sexy stuff'],1,Parent of a 10,101112,13,16,2

638,Batman & Robin,2015-12-25,The best Batman-film of the 1990's,"If Leslie H. Martinson's Batman-film has been criticized as too goofy and Tim Burton's Batman-films as too dark, then this film by Joel Schumacher has finally gotten into the right track, although not exactly as right as Christopher Nolan did with ""Batman Begins"". All these newer Batman-films are, of course, too futuristic, as the real setting for Batman should be late 1930's or 1940's. That's something we should see in the future Batman-films.

But anyway, George Clooney did a nice job as Bruce Wayne. He has the talent for portraying both, a perfect gentleman and dark revenger. The story is a bit mystical, even somewhat fantasy-alike. The enemies, Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy, are interesting, but of course, they lack the notoriety of Joker. This fact also leads to conclusion that this film is more family-friendly than, especially earlier, films by Tim Burton. This film is a bit carnevalized, still dark, and somewhat violent, but it goes closer to right Batman than the earlier attempts.

In the end, this film is not the ultimate Batman-film, but still worth of watching.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models', 'Violence & scariness']",2,Adult,Unk,11,12,3

They were both horrified with the violent scenes in the beginning of the movie (in the lab) and were exposed to a lot of coarse sexual inuendoes in this film.

the cat suit looks good, the stunts are impressive,and Halle Berry is in it.
now unfortunately that was all that was good.

on the other hand, the dialog was bad, the plot was beyond stupid, the Halle Berry character confuses me(being half good half evil) and the puns ARE AWFUL(kinda reminds me of batman and robins freeze puns).

this does have violence, this does have sex and even has a little drinking and drug use.

if you are looking for a good cat women, look at the animated series or comics this is a terrible film from beginning to end.

if you are forced to watch this (for whatever reason) turn off the sound and enjoy the visuals youll be much happierShow less",,1,Adult,Unk,14,13,1
