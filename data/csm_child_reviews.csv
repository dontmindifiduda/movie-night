0,Cats,2019-12-19,Don't even bother.,I can't believe some idiots gave this movie 4/5 stars. This movie is one of the worst of all time. This movie seriously makes the Sonic Movie seem like The Godfather. Anyways this just sucks.,['Violence & scariness'],3,Kid,12,10,18,1
1,Cats,2019-12-28,Cats:  Get Ready To Waste Your Time,"This is the most horrible,  God-forsaken movie I've ever seen.  So bad,  I wanted to walk out.  Why?  Well let's see----the same chord being played over and over?  A lack of character development?  Oversexualized commonplace actions?  Songs that are 17 minutes long?  That's not all folks.  It only goes downhill.  The main character does NOTHING in the movie at all.  The ending is just creepy and garbage.  You have a old cat staring at you,  which just makes me cringe.  This movie broke the one rule of being a movie.   NOT BREAKING THE FOURTH WALL.  The point of a movie is to be entertaining and enthrall you into the world of it and makes you want to stay.  However,  I just wanted to walk out the second it started.   The writing was just horrible and the story doesn't even make sense.  Also,  ""Memory"",  the song that is well known in Cats,  was transposed 5 octaves,  and the whole song and the key change was just cut off thanks to the terrible writing and lack of keeping the okay-ish material from the play.   Furthermore,  the jokes are just badly timed and just get disturbing.  And the fact that all the songs that are important to the story are literally satanic chants,   is just a big facepalm to the mere movie itself.    Sometimes,  I got very uncomfortable,  and for this to be a PG movie, it gets pretty....uh......how do I say this?  Flashy? 
 Uh, yeah,  you get the picture.  This movie is best for 13 year olds or mature tweens who want to torture themselves.   So if you wanna see garbage on the big screen,  watch Cats!Show less",['Sexy stuff'],3,Teen,13,10,11,1
2,Cats,2020-01-03,"Not for Dog People, but seriously...ITS BAD","I was disappointed at the lack of Dogs in the Cats movie. I was surprised at the number of literal cats in the movie. In fact, I expected only CGI, but in my theater, there were cats running throughout the aisles.  It was crazy. They were purring throughout the movie and I couldn't hear the sound very well. One cat jumped up on me and ate my popcorn. The actual movie was pretty....disappointing. I expected more dogs. DO NOT SEE IF YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY LIKE CATS. 

Okay that was a joke...but if i'm being completely honest, the movie was a flop. It was flashy, tacky, distasteful, disturbing, and not worth seeing. The acting was sub-par and as was the singing. The plot did not flow well, and it was hard to follow. I almost walked out of the theater but I deemed it disrespectful. Every second of the movie was worst than the last, and there were clearly some things they forgot to CGI out. I really thought some of the actors and actresses in the movie were above the stupidity that this movie brought. At the end, the fourth wall was broken. That's like rule #1 of what not to do in movies. It is a fun movie to make fun of, but honestly its just really, really bad. I can't think of one good thing about it actually.  Don't see unless torture is your thing...god I hope its not..Show less",['Sexy stuff'],3,Teen,17,10,8,1

13,Cats,2020-04-09,Less horny than stage production ,"CATS 2019 is admittedly a monstrosity, but it could be worse. Jason Derulo did surprisingly well, the songs all went like they were supposed to, and the dance that I was able to see past the CGI was fine. But this is no 1998 stage recording of CATS.
This version cut out some inappropriate things such as the raw sexual magnetism of Rum Tum Tugger as well as the orgy scene (I think). 
But at what cost? I would rather they not CGI out Jason Derulo’s penis, for them to fire Rebel Wilson and James Corden, to not write a bad new song making Victoria sound like a whiny brat, to not force a hetero romance between Mr. Mistoffelees and Victoria. But we don’t get what we want. We get star studded casts that can’t sing or act and aren’t even funny, sorry this is mainly at the disgusting casting of Rebel Wilson. She gave literally one of the worst performances I’ve seen in my entire life. Every single thing she did I despised. She didn’t have a single good joke, she couldn’t sing any harmony in her song let alone share the spotlight for the original gorgeous 3 part harmony, she can’t dance, she served only as a fat joke, when she took off her skin I nearly threw up, I don’t think I’ve ever felt this sort of hatred toward a performance before. I would’ve given this movie 4 stars if not for her mockery of a beloved theatrical role. Also the choreography couldn’t even be seen within all that CGI, when one of their huge advertising points was having the choreographer from Hamilton. And Tom Hooper, my dear fellow, please do the world a favor and never direct a musical again. All directing choices feel steeped in such hate of the medium of musical theatre. Tom simply doesn’t understand how to direct one and should probably stick to regular film. Also Taylor Swift wasn’t very good in this. Her voice doesn’t work well for the song she got to sing as a solo and not as a duet because god forbid Taylor should share the spotlight with another singer. I liked the ballet guy who played Munkustrap though, I thought he was pretty cool. Mr. Mistoffelees was also taken in a very different (straight) direction, but it kind of works and I didn’t hate it. I wish they let Jason Derulo do more though, I feel like he was held back. I also wish there was more sex but I get that adaptations can’t always copy the original.
I got off track, but so did this movie. I highly recommend it to watch before watching the 1998 recording so you can appreciate how wonderful good casting and choreography can be.Show less",,3,Teen,17,10,8,3

Between Dench's horrible performance, the lack of a cohesive story, and kind of slow musical sequences, it really does suck quite a lot.

40,Cats,2020-08-11,Better then I thought it would be.,"I’m a Cat fan, so I’m biased. Ever since I was little I wanted to see a movie adaptation of the musical. It’s a really weird childhood dream to have, but there you go. However, I always imagined it animated. Not with weird CGI cat people. I don’t think it’s as bad as people say.

The person I went with liked it because she too, was biased, being a Taylor Swift fan. The only other people there were some heckling teenage boys.

Most scenes I had to wonder if I was hallucinating due to the visuals. Really think they should have just made animated shorts or something. The musical was just as weird, but it was darker and more immersive. But I REALLY appreciate how it didn’t try to hard to add a plot. Because if they had tried to force A PLOT on a movie based off a musical based off a poem book that’s based off a series of letters... I think I would have burst out sobbing. If anything, it managed to make the musical a bit more coherent.

It definitely missed out on some of the musicals charm. However, I was really impressed with the characterization of the White Cat and Mr. Mistofflees, who I felt stayed true to the musical. Two of the scenes, the Mr. Mistofflees one and the Heavyside Layer one, impressed me and felt magical. A lot of the other ones kinda repulsed  me.

So I think they did their best, and stayed true to the source material. I’m not sure you guys realize that Cats is SUPPOSED to be a bizarre mess. Way more magical on stage, though. The reason I rated it 11+ is because no one younger is going to be able to sit through it unless they’re a diehard Cats fan. And some of you conservatives are going to throw a hissyfit if you ever see this movie, just warning you.

56,Cats,2020-04-02,Should You Watch Cats 2019? No. Stick to the Original. ,"Are you a fan of the musical Cats, or the 1998 movie based on it? If so, you might agree with me; the Cats 2019 movie did a terrible job paying homage to the original. 

I think that the new Cats movie did not pay tribute to the original because the characters looked so weird, which made me only see them as humans, not cats. In the original, all the makeup and costumes made the actors look like real cats and I felt like I was in a world of felines. In the new movie, they had fingers, human noses and mouths. One of the weirdest examples is that they made Old Deuteronomy look like a naked mole rat wearing a fur coat.

Also, they changed one of the main storylines of the movie. Instead of the villain, Macavity, just kidnapping the leader, Old Deuteronomy, he kidnapped her and many of the other main characters, such as Jennyanydots, Bustopher Jones, Gus the Theatre Cat, and Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat. This weakens the story because in the original, it seemed more likely that Macavity would get his way. 

Third, they changed the cats’ personalities. In the original, Cassandra and Exotica are dancing cats with only two lines and their dance moves are very acrobatic. The Rum Tum Tugger is a flirt, and Jennyanydots is motherly. In the new movie, these same cats are very snotty and rude, and I miss their kindness. Others are lacking in self-confidence, such as Victoria and Mr. Mistoffelees, who is not proud of his magical powers. In the original, Mr. Mistoffelees’ attitude is, “I’m here, I’m amazing”, and Victoria, just like Cassandra and Exotica, is a dancing cat with terrific acrobat skills that are amazing to watch. 

Last, they changed the setting. In the original, the cats were snug in an alleyway, safe from animal control and other dangers. However, in the 2019 movie, the setting is right on the street, just the perfect place to be seen. 

In conclusion, I think that the 2019 Cats movie did a terrible job paying homage to the original. The new cats look weird, they changed the main story line, they changed the personalities of the cats, and they changed the setting. My advice is to skip this movie and watch or re-watch the 1998 movie.Show less",['Sexy stuff'],3,Kid,9,10,9,1

One main thing was how the movie was given a plot. The musical has basically no ongoing plot what so ever and is just a bunch of cats singing and having a good time with the occasional appearance of the antagonist. In the movie, however, there was a clear plot. It was still good, but I wish it hadn't strayed that far from the musical. There were also clear main characters in the movie that there weren't in the musical. The musical is an ensemble show, meaning there were no main characters or roles higher than others.

I think some people don’t like it because they don’t understand theatre, if you don’t like musicals your obviously not going to like this film so why did you bother if you like to watch musicals or films with a lot of dialogue it’s probably not for you but over all the film is so good and emotional. I’ve been in the musical cats and I loved this rendition, I went to see it with my mom who was surprised that she actually really liked it she said she didn’t like the idea that they remade it because of the version she watched when she was younger but she said it was completely different in a really good way. The only negative if the film was when the cats spun around in the air they went unusually fast and it didn’t seem realistic but it didn’t change that I loved the film should definitely watch it again and recommend it to anyone thinking about seeing itShow less",,3,Teen,14,10,8,5
61,Cats,2020-02-13,Shimbleshanks the railroad cat,"Shimbleshanks the railroad cat was definitely the best part of the movie, his red suspenders and matching hat manage to tap dance their way into everyone's heart. The scene where Taylor Swift and Macavity drugged everyone with catnip was a bit odd, and was the one cat lady controlling them during one of the song numbers? A bit strange, but overall the movie was very interesting. I found it a bit odd some of them were wearing fur, especially if it was the same color as their actual fur. The human hands and feet made it a bit more odd as well, especially because there was no fur on their hands.
The lighting and backgrounds were cool, and like I said, Shimbleshanks the railroad cat was incredible. But really that's the only reason it gets 2 stars instead of 1.

I would like to imagine this town they live in is their own, completely abandoned by all humans, probably because the cats had overthrown the leader of the town, to have freedom to sing and dance as it is their passion. The humans couldn't compete with their talent, and left the town out of shame and embarrassment.

Don’t watch it and support the people who made this. It’s horrible. There is absolutely no plot, just a bunch of cats introducing themselves. There’s almost no dialogue, just song for the entire duration of the film. My eyes couldn’t stay focused on the screen for more than a minute before I was either bored or just disturbed at the VFX. The visuals in the movie look like they aren’t even finished. The fact that this film was released I honestly can’t get my head around.
This is the worst movie I have seen, perhaps ever. I’m sure some people can derive some enjoyment from this film but certainly not me. Honestly a cat cult could’ve been a pretty cool pitch for a horror film but ‘the most joyful event of the season’? Rebel Wilson eats cockroaches with peoples faces on them and unzips her skin! Does that sound joyful to you? I need t wash my eyes out with holy water I swear this film opened me up to evil cat spirits. Also, what does the word Jellicle mean? It’s used for everything.

83,Cats,2020-01-02,DITURBING but a fine storyline.,"Good Side

For one I thought the storyline was good and full of interesting characters that carry different personas. These characters all good role models other than the Mcavity (Idris Elba). SPOILER ALERT: Victoria (Francesca Hayward) is very kind to Grizabella (Jenifer Hudson) and she helps her be chosen at the Jellicle Ball. Grizabella is a well developed character who is the heart of the movie and doesn't let anything stop her and is the greatest role model of the movie.

Bad Side

WHY? Why was this movie even made!!!
The CGI is absolutely terrible! Kinda disturbing. At one point in the movie, a cat's collar is far too off from the neck. Also near the beginning, Jennyannydots (Rebel Wilson) takes of her skin to reveal shiny clothing. IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD SEE OUT OF A HORROR MOVIE. 
Also, the cats are all overly sexualised because of CGI. And last but certainly not least, the camera angles and camera motion. 

Final Conclusion 

This movie is good but it depends on what type of person you are. You could be someone who doesn't get motion sickness easily and can't get disturbed over bad CGI and
'silly little things' like that. If you're like that this movie is perfect for you. If not, I wouldn't recommend this to you.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models', 'Sexy stuff']",3,Kid,11,10,11,2

I couldn't believe what a good job they did with everything. The dances are extremely impressive and lively, the dancers move in a sort of magical way. The acting is entertaining and good, especially Francesca Hayward, who is lovely to watch, and brings Victoria to the screen wonderfully and innocently. Jennifer Hudson is heartbreaking and powerful as Grizabella, and plays her so realistically. The singing is awesome and fun. The magician and Victoria are so lovely to watch together. In the end, which was done brilliantly so all the loose ends were tied up, I felt like laughing and crying at the same time. Amazing musical.

85,Cats,2019-12-30,"Depends on the Person, I Guess","When I heard they were making Cats into a movie, I was furious. 

Since I’m an avid theatre fan, I believe it’s incredibly hard to execute a solid movie musical, and most studios botch it. So, I was upset that they were messing with a musical I’ve loved since I saw it in the theatre (when I was 8). 

The only real reason I saw it was to make fun of it. But enough with that, so what did I think of the movie?

As a moviegoer with no previous knowledge of the show, I was disturbed. 

But as a theatre fan, I was thrilled. 

The movie was executed beautifully. From the choreography, to the music that had been stylized, almost everything was wonderful. However, I recommend that you have exposure to the musical/soundtrack before seeing it so it makes sense and you can enjoy it more. 

Really, I loved it. My parents hated it. My friends had mixed reviews of it. It’s up to you and what you know you enjoy. 

If you enjoy musicals with stunning choreography and music, with great messages, this is for you. 

My only beef with the movie; the CGI was creepy, and they could have casted it better. Some roles should have gone to different people.  But that’s really it.Show less",['Positive Messages'],3,Teen,14,10,8,4

Placing these characters in the uncanny valley feels right, something about there cat like characteristics along with there human ones just makes you feel uneasy. After  awhile you get used to it, you feel less weird and start to enjoy the music and dancing. I’m not sure if kids would find it scary or if it’s just us but if they have seen the preview and we’re fine they will be just fine during the film and I’m sure they’ll enjoy it. I didn’t notice anything inappropriate that I noticed but as there is an antagonist in any children’s or adults story there is an antagonist, he tricks people picking at there flaws and capturing them, it’s all just like something in a fairytale and is a good one to take the kids to but I’m not sure if I would recommend going for yourself if you do prepare to be disappointed.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models']",3,Teen,14,10,9,3

91,Cats,2019-12-24,Very enjoyable but can be confusing,"I have been a fan of cats since I was very little and when I saw the ad on YouTube for the movie I was ecstatic. I went to see the movie and while it was good it had some issues. Rebel Wilson did not pull off the role of Jenny Enny dots. The female cats were over-sexualized beyond belief. Violence wise the movie was not bad except a claw in another cats head and then macavity  himself would be a little scary for some of the younger kids. The rum tum tugger  has always been somewhat of a sex symbol and with Jason Derulo at the helm, I’m sure that many younger teen girls are swooning.  The most over sexualized cat was bombalurina which was played by Taylor Swift. There was also some pelvic thrusting and a reference to cats being neutered. I thought that it was a fun movie nonetheless. It may be confusing for those who had never heard of the musical. The only other thing I didn’t particularly enjoy was how the skimbleshanks number was focused more on the tap dancing than the railroad aspect.Show less",['Sexy stuff'],3,Teen,13,10,8,4
92,Cats,2019-12-22,"Strange, odd film may be entertaining to some.","I've not seen the stage production, and so I had no real idea what I was in for.

The story seems weird, the film is indeed a musical but the songs serve no purpose to the story and act as filler, some are catchy however, and the producers did not modernise the music with dubstep and rap (unlike Aladdin and the Lion King remakes by Disney) and that, I can respect. The songs are one of the only decent things of the movie.

The visuals are by far the strangest things of the film. The characters look bizarre and need no explanation, but one thing that no one is talking about is how the scale of the characters and scenery change drastically. Sometimes the characters appear almost human-size compared to the buildings/objects, and in the next scene they are as tiny as mice.

Overall it was fine, I understand how this could appeal to children. It's fun if you can just relax for the duration, but I'm unsure if fans of the musical would like this.Show less",,3,Teen,14,10,8,2

Then Paul slaps the horse in the butt and the horse kicks him and he fly's to the car and flops to the ground. My Dad and I couldn't stop laughing, we were cracking up. This movie is a slapstick masterpiece. I'm super surprised that ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2"" was named one of the worst movies of 2015.

As it turns out, it could be (and is) that bad. John Travolta can be a good actor, as proven in Pulp Fiction and such, but he earned his Razzies with this God-awful performance. The rest of the cast is  equally bad. Which might not be their fault considering the screenplay may be the worst of the decade. The sets are ugly, the camera angles feel repetitive (how many angled shots can one have), and the color is dank and miserable (I am not usually one to note that kind of stuff, which should tell you it's THAT BAD). It's so droll as well. Most of the above could be forgiven if it had thrills or was affecting, but no. There is one reason to watch this, and that is because it is a true accomplishment of sheer awfulness. It's almost like they WANTED it to be terrible.

The actors do their best with what they are given; I was thoroughly entertained by John Travolta's intentionally over-the-top performance as Terl, and Barry Pepper was a strong, solid, relatable hero in Jonnie. Kim Coates was supportive and funny as Carlo, and he had some good chemistry with Pepper as his loyal friend. Forest Whitaker was also hilarious as Ker, Terl's right hand man and whipping boy, even if his one-liners got a little excessive around the third act. The action is well choreographed and exciting, with awesome explosions and decent CGI. The costumes and makeup are fantastic, with good leathery suits and grungy, weird dreadlocks for the Psychlos and some nice loincloth robes for the humans. But best of all are the sets, which intrigued me to the fullest extent. They were dark, dank, and depressing, and it's quite sobering to see libraries crumbling to dust, or an old city being used as a Psychlo fortress. Aside from some poorly developed characters and a few absurd plot points, like fighter jets being usable after 1,000 years in storage, I consider this film to be a thoughtful, exciting, and intriguing sci-fi good time that achieves what it's trying to be: a fun comic book movie.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models', 'Violence & scariness', 'Language', 'Drinking, Drugs & Smoking']",1,Teen,13,13,9,4

174,Twilight,2020-11-16,Arguably one of the worst films ever made,"Every single time I've met anyone who legitimately enjoys this franchise, the first thing they comment on is the actors' appearances rather than the actual content of the movie. And to be honest... it's difficult to critique this seriously, because the cinematography alone feels like a home movie shot by a couple of highschool or college kids for their school assignment. The romance between Edward and Bella doesn't send a good message to younger viewers at all. Edward is incredibly manipulative, not to mention the fact that he is a century older than her. Bella becomes infatuated with him to the point of unhealthy obsession. And, of course, the dialogue -- where should I start? It's cringe-worthy at best, mainly due to the notoriously bad acting, and I can't tell if the script is actually written terribly or if it's just due to the original content of the novel. 

The only redeeming quality about Twilight is the soundtrack, which is at least bearable when analyzed separately. Muse got a nice bit of recognition from their placement in the baseball scene, but unfortunately the filming and graphic effects were just as amateurish in this scene and the song didn't necessarily do anything to help. So... unless you're just in it for Supermassive Black Hole or Decode, I can think of HUNDREDS of fantasy romance films that are actually worth your time, so I wouldn't waste your life on this one.Show less",,3,Teen,14,13,12,1

After seeing it I think that everyone needs to calm down a bit.  Bella is honestly wearing a t-shirt and underwear bottoms (not in a sexual way though, just cause that's what she sleeps in).  And for ""takes place on a bed"" well true but not in the inappropriate way your think.  Nothing bad even happens.  I'd say the worst part of this whole scene is the kissing sound effects.  That's it.  Now I'm not saying that you should let your 8-year old watch this but its really not as bad as you think.  Well Ok the kissing starts to get intense than stops before it can go anywhere (its only intense for just like five seconds).

Basically this movie is poorly done, the constant voiceover is only suppose to be for an introduction! The actress flat out sucks and has no emotion and the most interesting thing about Edward is his pretty boy face! Not even pretty! This movie ruined vampires for me until I saw ‘What we do in the shadows’. Whenever people think vampires now they think this crap, traditional vampires are cool and dark, not sparkly! This is definitely a movie with bad role models, it teaches young girls that what Bella has with him is love but really it’s not! That’s not love! He stalks her and it freaks me out, if I were her, I would’ve pepper sprayed him a long time ago, you don’t need a man, girl! I’m glad I watched this as a teen and not younger cause it could’ve influenced me that that is what love is, instead I could mock it and laugh as a teen, very funny movie!

I don't know how to start. 
It's so cringey, it's hard to watch with other people. Very badly written, and Edward and Bella are definitely not as 'in love' as they were in the books. 
A lot of key details and scenes were missing. And again, it so embarrassing to watch with other people. The books were definitely way better, so read those and don't even bother with the movie. Also, instead of a warm, loving environment, everything looks cold and there is a limited color palette.

200,Twilight,2020-06-30,Just plain meh.,"If you want to watch a movie just to pass time or as a noise in the background and don't want to necessarily think too much about it, then this movie is for you. 

But, if you are a teen you should know that Edward's and Bella's relationship is extremely unhealthy. There is too big of a power imbalance in all aspects. Physically he is stronger than her. Financially he is richer than her and s*xually, he overpowers her as well (He has had 100 years of practice).  Edward is also a huge creep and I will go as far as to call him a pedophile. Bella is incredibly dependent on Edward. There is way too much staring at each other. If you cut out all the gasps, staring and sharp breaths taken; this would be a 30 min special. Every character other than Bella and Edward is far more interesting. The CGI sucks. The cinematography is not that great either. The only good part about this movie is the sound track.  

So, what I am trying to say is that, you should know that this is not what a healthy and romantic relationship looks like. Neither the production nor the acting is good. But, if you want to watch this for a good laugh or cringe, then go ahead. You won't be disappointed.Show less",,3,Teen,15,13,12,2

I'm trying to not bring out the bad stuff in it because I encourage 11 and up on it but there's quite a bit of suggestive stuff. My younger brothers, ages 6 and 8, are allowed to watch it because they don't know about all that stuff, if you know what I'm talking about. I think 11 is the perfect age. Also, there is some swearing in this movie. I think that people who are mature enough should be able to watch it.

It is mainly in the end when Edward and his family are fighting off the evil vampires trying to protect Bella. She gets bitten and one of her limbs snaps. That was a bit haunting personally for me.  While this is mostly blood, there are also some slight romance scenes that would be appealing to a tween girl.  Overall, my guidelines for this movie as a tween are:
1. Do not show to anyone under the age of 14
2. Make sure if you are a parent, do not show this movie to your child until you have watched it yourself from your child's perspective

Not an interesting story at all, bad messages, almost no dialogue, and the actors looked bored to death when they were in the movie. Bella and Edward have no reason to be with each other, they just like each other because they think they're so sexy or whatever (which they're not), and Bella is completely dependent on Edward for whatever happens to her. They are children pretending to be adult-like and failing epically at it. It shocks me how the parents don't even notice and put a stop to their little romance going on. Normally, in a teen romance movie where the characters make a bad decision (like choosing a ""soul mate"" because they're pretty and not because they're a good person or freaking make out in your underwear when you're only 16) it's cool if it is acknowledged that they shouldn't do it and even then it doesn't make an enjoyable film.

As a tween, I understand that twilight is just a story and should not be confused with reality, but not all tween girls will see the signs of unhealthy relationships in this movie. Bella is obsessive about her relationship. Edward violates Bella's privacy by watching her sleep at night. A couple of intimate scenes and intense violence (Bella's leg is stepped on and broken, she shrieks and she is bitten by a vampire.) are present. If you are considering letting your tween daughters watch this movie, be sure to let them know that Bella is not a good role model!Show less",,3,Kid,12,13,13,3
255,Twilight,2018-10-22,A delightful movie for all tweens and teens!,"I love this movie beyond belief. Kristen Stewart is a remarkable actress and plays the role of Bella well. 
Before parents jump to conclusions, let me just say that there is a few things that might bring them away from letting their daughters watch this. However, it is a splendid movie. 
The violence is one thing. The trio of wayward vampires chase a man, trap another, and one of them, a psycho captures Bella and begins to throw, kick, and then bites her. Edward bites a piece out of his neck, and then later Alice, Jasper, and Emmet tear his head off (barely shown) and burn him.
Another thing to consider is the romance part. Couples flirt and go to prom. Two girls go and shop and  wear prom dresses, making remarks about themselves and how hot they are. Edward and Bella make out on her bed (Bella is in short shorts NOT underwear and they are both fully dressed) and then they later go to prom. 
This movie is terrific and you should all watch it!!Show less",['Violence & scariness'],3,Teen,13,13,10,5

There is NO reason to watch this movie! And don't even get me started on Edward! He is creepy and weird and not at all romantic, no matter what other people are saying. I will agree that Robert Pattinson can be handsome. But in this movie, his looks are his only character trait! If you want to see Robert Pattinson at his best, watch Harry Potter 4.

Don’t even get me started with the acting. The book was much better, so just read the book instead. There was lots of blood and violence at the end, including vampires fighting, and them ripping each other’s flesh off of the opposite persons body.

The actual plot doesn't happen until 30 minutes into the film and even then it is terrible! The entire ""Edward and Bella"" romance is just ""gazing"" and even that is rather pathetic and badly done. I watched this with my mum and we both cracked up every single time there was a ""romance scene"" between them. The Bella in the film is not the same one I fell in love with in the books. She is more sullen and depressed and lacks the zest she had in the book. Overall, the entire film is rather bad and includes sex, attempted rape, stalking and death.

I was so excited to see the movie but after watching it I realized it wasn’t as good as the movie... yeah yeah you’re probably saying “the books are always better dummy” but being such a big fan of twilight my expectations were a little higher than what it gave me. The thing that disappointed me the most was that the story line was so off from the book. In my mind while watching the movie I thought I new what would happen next but it would end up being something so off from the book. 2nd; the movie was just not good quality.. not going into detail it just wasn’t the best quality! I do have to admit though, I have really grown to love it! I love that Robert Pattinson plays Edward Cullen and I think Kristen Stewart did a really good job as Bella! The other 4 movies were fantastic!! Just the first one didn’t come out with a bang! The other movies are higher quality and probably somewhat closer to the storyline... not perfect by no means but closer. :) over all this movie didn’t have any overly sexual scenes ( there’s one making out scene in Bella’s room, nothing terrible and ends pretty quickly) and some violence towards the end (blood, vampires fighting, nothing super terrible but might want to warn your kids about) if you’re kid can handle it itll be just fine!

288,Twilight,2017-09-04,"I think the movie looked really cheap and I didn't really like the animation, especially when the Vampires jump and it makes them look like they are flying. The book on the other hand, was AMAZING!! It didn't really have anything too bad. The only time I caught Drugs/Drinking/Smoking was when Bella took some unnecessary cold medicine because she was too nervous to fall asleep. As long as kids know that isn't okay, that little addition shouldn't be a worry. The violence was a little on the graphic side, but only in the book. (This is a review about the book, FYI) She hits her head on a mirror and it explains how it felt to her. She also faints at the smell of blood, so, in my opinion, it makes those parts stand out more. But, if kids are asking to read a book of this size, you'd be surprised at how other books of the same size explain the violent parts.  Also, in the movie, they literally snap the bad Vampire's head off. In the book, she is unconscious",,"['Positive role models', 'Violence & scariness']",3,Teen,13,13,11,5

Of course if you're logical you wouldn't do that in real life (this is only a movie after all) yet some children that enjoy this could try and be like those characters.

In my opinion the two worst things are when Bella is followed by a group of guys and is harassed and the relationships in the show including Bella's with her father and Edward.Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff']",3,Teen,13,13,12,2

Also, it makes things like breaking into a room to watch someone sleep seem romantic. That's not romantic that's breaking and entering.

331,Twilight,2014-02-22,Not Bad,"I am an avid twi-hard fan (read all books seen all movies ect..)
. If I had not read the original ""Twilight"" book, I would have not liked this movie much at all, because the special romance between Bella and Edward lacked the ""specialiness""  that it had in the book. The romance is too rushed and pictured a bit confusing and very controlling if you haven't read the book. I highly recommend reading the book first before viewing this movie. As for the movie, other than the confusing romance between the two main characters, the overall movie was fine. I do believe one scene is quite iffy though. When Edward and Bella first kiss. The kiss isn't while Bella is in appropriate attire (undies and a tee), and it is way too long and not as gentle or sweet as in , you guessed the book.Also,some parents might not like the fact that Edward has been sneaking into Bella's bedroom to watch her sleep. (Not creepy in the book) For violence, there is a bit of blood, the worst scene is where Bella has been bitten by James and he left behind a bloody crescent mark on her wrist. There is a teensy bit of rude humor in the scenes that include Bella's human friends. They joke about speedos, big boobs, and boys are constantly after Bella.
Overall, It wasn't too bad though a little iffy when it comes to Bella and Edward's romance.

332,Twilight,2014-02-22,,"I was shocked that so many had said such high ages. I honestly found nothing bad about this movie. Maybe the plot, though in this movie, its more so the idea of the plot that's scary, rather than the actual movie. There's kissing, and Edward watches Bella sleep, but that's so obviously creepy that it can't really be considered inappropriate. However at the end of the movie, James (the villain) bites Bella, and  there's a fight scene, however most of the focus was on Bella and it barely showed the characters ripping James up and burning him (how you kill vampires). The only real thing that I found scary was that Alice (Edward's 'sister') rips off James' head, however he has no insides, so it's not graphic at all.Show less",['Violence & scariness'],3,Kid,12,13,9,5

341,Twilight,2013-04-16,Suprisingly deep and intriguing vampire romance has lots of bite,"A male teenager like myself is not the kind of person you would expect to get into something like Twilight, and several reviews hailing it as a riotous unintentional comedy didn't raise my expectations either. But I gave the film a try nonetheless. And, to my immense surprise, it's actually a strong and intriguing romance. The actors were, admittedly, very good in their roles; Kristen Stewart was fascinating and at times three-dimensional as the love-struck and pretentious heroin, and Billy Burke was soft but firm as her father. Robert Pattinson looked and sounded perfect in his role as the creepy lover boy vampire, giving a very convincing American accent and offering some engaging chemistry with Stewart as her obsessive love interest. The Cullens were all convincing vampires, although I wish I could have seen a bit more of their dark sides (after all, they are vampires). The way the story was set up and the buildup of the romance was very well executed and interesting, even if it is wildly unrealistic that Bella would make such an assumption about Edward being a vampire so fast. The cinematography was bold and beautiful, with lots of dark lighting to represent the mood and tone. Plus, what is it with everyone talking about how god awful and laughable the dialogue and scriptwriting were? I thought they were fine, for what the story was trying to accomplish. Also, a lot of people say that the characters are bad role models and don't represent true love, but here's something you're not understanding: it's all trying to be a play on Romeo and Juliet. In that story, the two leads decide instantaneously that they are in love, and go so far as to end their lives when their rivaling families try to pull them apart. To go that far so fast is a rushed, pretentious, uncharismatic, and, well, half assed romantic relationship that shows that they were too young to realize what they were truly getting into. The way Bella and Edward instantly jump into a relationship and the way Bella goes so far as to ask to be turned into a vampire is very similar to the way Romeo and Juliet handled their relationship. Simply put, Bella and Edward aren't supposed to be good role models. They are two star-crossed lovers who are rushing into things. But that's the only real problem I have with the movie; it seems odd that it's presenting these characters as bad role models when we're trying to follow them and sympathize with them. In some ways, that's a problem I have with Romeo and Juliet as well. But that certainly wasn't enough to turn me away. I consider this movie to be sweeping, heartfelt, and enjoyable to watch. And to those who hail it as an unintentional comedy, I have only one thing to say: bite me.Show less","['Positive role models', 'Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff', 'Language']",3,Teen,14,13,12,4

347,Twilight,2012-12-23,TWILIGHT: The best money milker since SAW,"While other kids might be loosing their minds on how great this film is, I am not. I saw this movie and I have to say that it's terrible in almost every way.  The movie has poor acting, story, scenes, everything you could imagine and yet, it has spawned several sequels. Teens, especially girls, might go crazy with Robert Pattinson, and maybe that's why they insist on watching and rating this piece of dogs***  as a decent film. Fans might say that it has spawned several sequels because of it's greatness. No, it has spawned several sequels because millions of ignorant teenagers who have absolutely no taste for good movies went to see this and now the directors decided to ""milk"" the franchise until everyone forgets about it.

Teenagers who see this movie might not like actual good movies and might say that Twilight (or sequels) is/are the best movie/s of all time. Ignorants...

If you're a fan, go watch foreign movie ""Let the Right One In"" or it's american remake starring Chloë Grace Moretz ""Let Me In"", a far more superior vampire/romance movie than Twilight.

The only thing that keeps this movie up and running is Pattinson. Don't worry, this is just a ""thing"", people will soon stop with it.

352,Twilight,2012-11-13,Popular fantasy romance is nowhere as good - nor as bad - as expected. Tweens and up.,"""Twilight"" is a popular fantasy romance by Catherine Hardwicke.
The extreme hype of the movie franchise, and the novels, somehow seemed to take overhand. Due to its success, there were many critics calling it the worst movie of all time, and others which called it the best. 
Looking critically at it, ""Twilight"" is neither. It is not terribly bad, but still, it is not exactly good. The plot is not even that uninteresting, if you keep in mind that this was the first movie that depicted vampires as ""the good ones"". It played with the image that a vampire had, tried to create something new - and did so. Unfortunately, the adaption is rather negative. The romance between Bella and Edward seems a bit underwhelming, there are no big emotions like in ""Titanic"" or ""Gone with the Wind"". At some parts, the movie can be a bit silly, especially the baseball scene takes a lot of the athmosphere.
Also, the Twilight universe seems less thoughtful and consequent compared to other epic sagas such as ""Harry Potter"", ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"". It does not have the complexity that these franchises have.
The cast is not well-chosen, having a stiff, uninspired performance by Kristen Stewart, who seems more tired than anything else.
On the plus side, it is a better movie than most other blockbusters that come out nowadays, not having non-stop action and still something being diverting.
Also, the soundtrack by Carter Burwell (who did the overwhelming scoring in the Coen brothers' ""Fargo"") is excellent, being the highlight of this movie. 
""Twilight"" is not the worst movie of all time, but still has some fatal decisions made. If they would have chosen a better cast, and added more emotion to it, it could have been done much better. But the way it is, it simply is disappointing. --------------------------------
(SPOILERS may follow:)
There is actually only one scene keeping this movie from a PG rating:
a vampire traps Bella, throws her against a column, and then violently breaks her leg by punching against it (though not detailed, it is violent). Then she is bitten. However, she does not become a vampire when Edward saves her. The evil vampire is then killed off-screen by having his limbs removed. It is off-screen, this could have passed in a PG movie.

Moving on to more frighting matters, I'll state Edward's character. Mysterious guy who likes to watch a girl about 100+ years younger than him sleep.

436,Twilight,2010-10-19,Excellent,"Ah Twilight...I can say so many good things about this movie! Okay, so first I was pretty nervous to watch it, because I thought that they were not going to follow the book at all, and that they wouldn't pick the right people to play Bella, Edward etc. Man, was I wrong! They did this movie absolutely perfectly! They picked perfect people to play the characters, was filmed excellently, they did a very good job with the romance and showing how Edward was extremely protective without going too far. I would have to say that I like the book and the movie about the same, they are both excellent. Usually when they make a movie that his based off of a book, they don't really follow the book very well, but they followed the book excellently in this one. 5 stars!!Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Positive Messages', 'Positive role models']",3,Teen,14,13,8,5

Anyways, I like the action I guess, but there are definitly things to complain about. I truely think Bella and Edward are far too obsessed with eachother, its disturbing and kids are so obsessed with the movie they dicide to be clingy like that with their boy/girl friends. Nasty. And it worries me that kids far younger than allowed watch this and are obsessed too. Its 13 and up, ok? They can watch it, not like I can stop them, but I wouldn't let my kids watch it because of the obsessive cling it has on people. I mean there are kids at my school that pretend to be vampires, its freaky. I'm glad for Stephany Myers sucess, but its getting overdone. I am SO sick of them doing that 'Team Edward'-'Team Jacub' thing! Most of the times girls watch it just cuz Robert and Taylor are 'hot' I truely could care less about what they look like, why does it matter? Plus, the acting wasn't really good. It 'sucked' actually. 
So Twilight fans, don't say I don't know what I'm talking about and that I'm stupid and lame (so on) cuz that just shows how pathetic its going.

Language - None.
Sex - No nudity/sex but there is an extremely steamy make out scene in a character's bed, a character is viewed in his/her underwear and a t-shirt, some flirting and holding hands.

The Cullen Coven, definately Edward, are the positive role models showing love and care for the [helpless] 17 year-old Bella. Yet, the other vampire gangs, including the hunter, are evil and set to break the two up with the death of either partner.

I believe that teenagers who read and understand the book should like the movie based on it's representation of the book. The saga is hard to follow because of the many aspects and characters.

The violence at the end can be considerd a little much for young children because Bella falls quite a few times and end's up with blood on her leg's and a bite on her arm. The blood is shown. It also can be considerd violent as Edward takes bites out of James and Alice dicapitates him, not showing his head actually off his body, but the sound on her breaking his neck is heard and the movements of his head.

Who is there to look up to? Maybe the vegetarian clan of vampires, but Bella  is not a very good role model.

There is alot of violence though, so I wouldn't reccommend the movie for anyone under 8 years old.  Also, the s*xual behavior wasn't for younger kids.  ex: Edward sneaks into Bella's house at night, and then they start kissing, and if you watch it a number of times, you start to notice a few more details.  One is that Bella is in her underwear.  Another is that Edward is kind of pulling down Bella's underwear.  This is a great movie!  I reccommend it for girls, because it is a chick flick, and for older kids, due to that fact that Bella and Edward almost have s*x with eachother.Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff', 'Language']",3,Teen,13,13,8,4

I just wish that Bella had a little more emotional in the movie at the right times.

Its such bad acting and bad casting! The vampires are so white they're pale (I've read the book and they're not supposed to look creepy). Edward isn't the 'perfect guy', he's a creep. Bella is grumpy and doesn't look happy at any time during the movie. The movie is soo low budget and the special effects are really fake. The make up is bad and the acting (I said it before and I'll say it again) is absolutely disgusting.

Normally i HATE reading, butthis was the first series that i could not put that book down, i was up at night reading obsessivley and i loved it, i couldn't wait 'till the movie was out, so for my birthday my girfriends went to dinner and saw the movie at midnight. And man was i disapointed, i love kristen stewart but she was not right for bella at all! I didn't like edward either, mostly the characters disapointed me, and it was nothing like i pictured when reading the book. They left out half the book, and added some of the second into it!?!?! What is that about? Well, there was that one violent scene, no big deal. Wasn't scary at all, and yes there is that whol love interest thing going on between Bella and Edward, but that's what it's about, so if you didn't see that coming, wow! Overall i liked this movie, if i hadn't read the book i would have loved it. So if you read the book, unless you like disapointment, don't see this movie. I guess if you're ok with them messing up the story you'd like it, put it ruins your mental imagines of what happened, and this director sucked and screwed up twilight!

Bella gets bitten, people get shoved into mirrors and land on floors and James gets burned to death and gets his neck twisted by Alice. Lovely.

For one, it's missing special effects; I couldn't control my laughing when Edward was caryying Bella up the hill. Seriously, that's good stuff. Also, the script is a little weird, and the whole thing's just a bit cheesy, but it's still fun to watch. Plus, it was shot in Oregon, right near me! YAY!

646,Twilight,2009-04-12,God-Awful Movie,"Most people probably aren't going to agree with me, but I'm going to say it anyway: this movie sucked. It was absolutely horrible. The script was ridiculous, the plot of fragile (though you can't really blame the directors for that since it was relatively faithful to the book), and the acting was just plain awkward. It was obvious that none of the actors, especially the two leads, were comfortable with their roles, and the interactions between the characters Edward and Bella was honestly painful to watch. Besides the awful acting and script, the movie was slow and redundant and the end couldn't come fast enough. While it's hard to criticize a movie that was based on a book, especially when it follows the book so closely, I think that this movie could have been much better. They couldn't have done anything about the pitiful plot (which didn't emerge until after halfway through the movie), the producers and directors could have found much better actors and writers. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Do yourself a favor, take your ten bucks and see a that actually has something to offer.Show less",,3,Teen,16,13,9,1
647,Twilight,2009-04-12,Ehhhhh :/,Well obviously my two sisters are completely obsessed with this book. I probably would have enjoyed it far more if I hadn’t had to watch it 7 times. The one scene with when they share a kiss is pretty graphic. There is no nudity but Bella is caught in a group of I guess you could say drunk phrat boys. Edward comes to save the day but he hints in that they were thinking rape by saying “you have no idea of the vile repulsive things they were thinking.” Lastly the final scene were a vampire is killed is very graphic. While there is no blood you can clearly see his head ripped off and thrown into a fire. It kind of shocked me I wasn’t expecting it.

The only concern really needed is the fact Ed and Bella have a relationship that is very intense.

You didn't know she broke anything until she got to the hospital. the blood was hardly there. THEY ARE VAMPIRES! yes they kill things! She didn't have any pants on because in the book she fell asleep in her clothes and when she woke up a few hours later she pulled hers pants off and went back to sleep. they just combined that with another part of the story. I wish they had clarified why she was in her underwear! whatever, ill let that one slide. The reason I said it was ok for 10 was because when i was 10 and i saw this i would have been fine. I really am not that mature. I just dont have crazy out of control parents.I understand that your rating these movies for parents with crazy children or children with crazy parents or both.

661,Twilight,2009-03-22,Right on the spot pg-13,"This is a good movie for kids my age, and I think that this was an underrated movie. As the reviews said, the acting was corny, but they were wrong. The acting was corny sometimes, including the main three villains. The two main roles did a very good job though. There is barley any swearing in this movie for a pg-13. The action was quite strong at the end,but suitable for children 10 and up. The behavior was like every other teenagers dream or how they act at high school. There was no drugs, only Edward being in love with Bella so much, it was like she was his own brand of heroin. The sex was pretty iffy though, where there was some kissing, and a passionate scene which ends up with the two main roles kissing on the bed while Bella was in her panties. Over all, this movie is suitable for children 11 and up.Show less",,3,Kid,11,13,11,4

Bella and Edward obviously have romantic moments, but i dont recommend this book or movie for 13 year olds only because they become obsessed with having their own ""edward."" They want a perfect boyfriend thats hot, funny, protective, and loving. Guys can and some do have all these characteristics, but the perfect boyfriend simply does not exsist. I read this book when i was 13 and i did become like that. then i realized that was stupid to think that way. Its a great and well written for older teens, but any younger and i think thats wrong unless were tlkin bout a very mature 13 yr old.Show less",,3,Teen,17,13,14,3

666,Twilight,2009-03-20,Twilight revue,"Twilight is an amazing movie filled with romance. But don't get thinking it's a chick flick. Although Twilight is mainly a romance, the romance is NOT bettwen a girl and boy. It's bettween a girl named Bella and a Vampire named Edward. So it appeals to boys and girls. Thiers miled violance, but still violance (for boys) and miled Romance (for girls). And don't think im just giving that from a girls point of vue. I have two older brothers who enjoyed this movie almost as much as I did. Thier's no hard-core swearing-The worst word is ""damn it"" No drugs or somkeing thier is alcahal but all you see is a beer. but you don't see anyone drinking.
The volance is miled and thier are no bad scenes with romance just kissing, holding hands, and flirting.

669,Twilight,2009-03-19,What a good movie!,"Twilight is a movie i personaly think children atleast 10 or 11, can see w/ an adult. It all depends on the parent. I think that video on the twilight page that said all that horible stuff about you shouldn't let your kids see this or something like that. No! You can't really stop your kids! Fathers are the main problems with younger ones at like 10 years old. I saw a father say, ""I don't want my son going goth!"" It's not goth! Just adventurous, romantic and it keeps you biting your nails and at the edge of your see while your watching it! At parts, like when bella and edward kiss, who cares because everyone will have their first kiss sometime. Like I said, it depends on the parent. A parent even said to a child that was 11,""You can go see the movie, but you can not read the book until i read it so i can see what it is like."" That is a very good idea, but when you say that you get the kids's hope up, like you will let them read it. Just give it a chance, and if you don't want your child to see it or read all four books then you don't have to. I honestly don't think Breaking dawn is a very appropriet book to read though.So please give it a chance! You don't HAVE to stick with it though.Show less",,3,Teen,14,13,10,5

If you didn't read the book first, you'll get a little lost now and again, but still a great movie. I thought some characters were a little off, especially Laurents, totally different than what I pictured. There was a small technical problem now and again, such as in the scene where they are all meeting at Edwards house, Bella makes a joke, and everyone is suppost to laugh except Rosalie, but you could tell that she was trying not to laugh. It was subtle, but noticable. Another part was in the last scene. When they are talking while they are dancing, at one point they stop dancing, but keep talking while the camera zooms in on there faces, but the background is still rotation even though they are standing still. The only other problem with it, was there was a lot of spinning of the camera and the actors, which made me a little dizzy. But I get motion sickness sometimes, so don't not see it because of what I say.

They left out the part where she wakes up and Edward is still there, that is one of my favortie parts. I bit my lip the entire time, clawed my arm, leg, chair, anything really. When it was done, they had really screwed over the prom scene and I heard people behind my saw stuff like, It was not that bad, followed the book pretty well. I slide down even farther down in my chair and covered my eyes and laughed. I did not care if they heard me or not. I have to say one thing I really hated, Bella's truck.

The Only Thing About This Movie That Could Have Been Better Was The Fact That The Begining Was a Little Rushed. Edward And Bella Didn't Have As Much Time To Grow, But It Still Worked Out Okay. The Scene In The Meadow Was Replaced With The Scene In The Woods. This Was One Thing That They Changed That I Thought Worked Out Really Well With The Rest Of The Movie's Story Line.

Instead, it just came off that she didn't care. I think, however, that this is the kind of movie I need to Netflix so I can watch it again. I wasn't  sure it was the movie that I hated, or just the sketchos sitting in front of me making me uncomfortable. I gave this movie three stars because the last twenty minutes of the movie was ridiculously good. I'll see this movie again, and maybe it wil1 be as good as all of you guys say it is.

No one can live up to the beauty of the characters, but the casting was great, and is about as close to the Cullens as you can get. For people that haven't read the book, it might be confusing. I am a big fan of the series, even before Twilight became popular, when it was unknown that a movie was in the makings. What was disappointing for me was how there was barely any romance, which is what every girl loves. I think that the director tried to make it more boy-friendly, but the books are intended for girls.

The plot was good and it went by the book, but the acting was much to be desired. The cast list was quite good. (especially JAMES !! a.k.a Cam Gigandet)! There was a bit too much dialogue and some very cheesy lines, but that was to be expected. What was up with Bella and Chief Swan going to the diner EVERY DAY!

Bella sees visions of Edward whenever she does idiotic things, like jumping on the back of some random mans motorcycle or running of the edge of a cliff into rapid waters, so she of course does things like this.

795,Twilight: New Moon,2013-04-18,"The newest moon is decent, but not full","I found it puzzling how many people were disgusted by the first Twilight. It certainly wasn't hated by everyone, but the bad reviews were pretty bad. Several people even found it unintentionally funny because of its dialogue. I never found a problem with the dialogue or the plot; in fact, I thought it was very good. But reviews for the second film, New Moon, were worse; and honestly, I can't really blame the critics on that one very much. I mean, I still marginally enjoyed the movie, but less so than the first film. Its tone is much darker than that of the first film, focusing more on darkness and depression. This tone is somewhat enjoyable to watch, but its stuffed to the brim with ridiculousness; after Edward leaves in order to protect Bella, she starts to do dangerous things so that she can see visions of Edward telling her not to do it. The fact that she would throw herself off a cliff, smash her head into a rock, and get on a drunk's motorcycle just so she can see visions of Edward feels so outright ridiculous to me. And while I still like Kristen Steward, Robert Pattinson, and Billy Burke, I think that Taylor Lautner was overly-sentimental, flat, and at times even laughable as Jacob, even though he looked the part pretty well. But a large part of those negative traits is due to the fact that he is a terribly written character; he acts so pushy around Bella to get her to admit she loves him, which is exactly the wrong thing to do in a situation where her boyfriend is gone and she is having screaming nightmares about him. And I think the part where the characters are in Italy talking to the Volturi is dragged out and incomprehensible. Yet the film still does have its plusses; outside of the parts where she tries to kill herself to see visions of Edward, the scenes where she tries to make friends with Jacob and cope with Edward's absence felt genuine, and you can see Lautner at least trying to act supportive and caring. Like I said earlier, setting Lautner aside, the performances were good, especially Michael Sheen, who was delightfully hammy and devious as Arrow, the leader of the Volturi. The CGI for the werewolves was appropriately awesome, and the action scenes, while scarce, were delectable. In the end, it doesn't hold up as one of the series' best, but it's still decent.Show less","['Positive role models', 'Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff', 'Language', 'Consumerism']",3,Teen,14,13,12,3

    *
      Messages:
      Bella, while in some ways very mature, is the poster child for obsessive love in this movie. She intentionally acts recklessly in order to see Edward in her mind, which isn't a positive message to send young girls. And her relationship with Edward, while loving, continues to determine her happiness, as evident in her three months of catatonic depression after their break-up early in the film. Edward is downright suicidal at the thought of losing Bella forever, and his decision to provoke the Volturi is literally self-destructive. Platonic friendships are shown as being fraught with sexual tension, which is also iffy for tweens and adolescents. All of that said, there's a lot of selflessness here, too, with characters putting themselves at risk to help others. 

    *
      Role models:
      Even though Bella is an incredibly loyal friend and girlfriend, she also has far too much of her self esteem wrapped up in her intense relationships with Edward and Jacob. She never feels that she's worthy of Edward, and she admits to feeling selfish in the way that she clings to Jacob even while telling him she can never love him ""that way."" That said, Edward and Jacob are both very protective of Bella, who is in turn protective of each of them. They all get a chance to save each other and don't hesitate to do so. And Charlie and Bella's father-daughter relationship, while not completely honest on Bella's part, is very close. 

    *
      Violence:
      Notably more action and violence than in the first film. Early in the movie, Jasper almost attacks Bella, leading to a fight between him and Edward. Accident-prone Bella falls, bleeds, and gets bruised several times and in one case almost drowns to death. Victoria and the Wolf Pack have a big fight, as do the werewolves and Laurent. Bella slaps Sam; Paul then becomes aggressive and lunges at her in werewolf form, only to be caught in a fight with wolf-Jacob. The Volturi's minions dismember a guilty vampire (it's quick and not much is shown, but the effect is gory), almost kill Edward and Bella, and make Edward writhe in pain.

      Notably more action and violence than in the fi…
    *
      Sex:
      Although there's nothing explicit, all of Bella and Edward's scenes are filled with passionate looks, hugs (including one in which he's shirtless), and brief-but-intense kisses. Jacob holds Bella's hand and stares at her longingly, and they share several close embraces (two while he's shirtless) and at least three ""almost kisses."" Other couples are shown holding hands, hugging, and kissing. No shortage of shirtless, buff guys, courtesy of the La Push Wolf Pack. 

    *
      Language:
      Just like the books, the worst is a few exclamations of ""what the h--l,"" ""da-mit,"" and ""oh my God,"" plus derogatory barbs like ""weird,"" ""wet dog,"" ""bloodsucker,"" etc. 

    *
      Consumerism:
      Volvo once again supplies Edward's car of choice (this time it's an XC60); other featured car brands include Porsche and Mercedes. Bella's computer is an Apple MacBook, and she and Alice fly Virgin America to Italy (which is amusing, since that division of Virgin doesn't fly to Europe). The movie also has huge merchandising tie-ins with Volvo, Burger King, and Hot Topic.

The end was the worst, nothing like the end in the book. Believe me, i have read the books AT LEAST 10 times each. He ends off with MArry me and she gasps and then credits. very stupid ending. However, once I got the DVD, I read over the book again, It was pretty good. Definitly not the best Twilight, but it was good. Bella is VERY depressed like state for the majority of the movie. She hops onto a bike with a random biker, she jumps off of a cliff, she completley trashes her socal life. But in the end she shows courage, strength, dedication.

It's all about some self-center, whiny teenage girl whom needs a boyfriend to validate herself. The men in which she ""needs"" in her life are not good in general. Edward is an obsessive, abusive, undead stalker who tries to kill himself if he can't be with bella. Not a good message. Jacob isn't as bad and proves to be a more genuine character but his entire role in the movie involves him pressuring Bella and ripping off his shirt.

The series creator, Stephenie Meyer, is very uptight. She makes $50 Million a year, and she refuses to give anybody thanks or airtime for themselves, rarely mentioning her family, even in interviews. Apparently, she would not give answers to a series of questions emailed by a non-fan, as she said, ""She doesn't waste her time on Hate Mail.""

Bella cliff dives and does other reckless things because she can see and hear Edward's voice when she does. The volturi scene is a little harsh, but parents can go on youtube and watch it to approve it. It's a truly amazing movie. Bella is defiantly a role model - so is Stephenie Meyer. Amazing movie.

She is now, as CSM puts it, ""the poster child for obsessive love."" This movie is actually more well-made than the first and has more violence. Since these improvements made it more entertaining, I'm probably gonna say that New Moon is better than Twilight. Thus, four stars. Can I give this 3 1/2, though? Rats. Anyway, I would rate this on for 13+ except for the fact that neither Bella's nor Edward's behavior should be copied by anyone of any age, much less 13-year-olds. The incessant screaming and wailing of Bella when Edward leaves her makes me want to cover my ears and scream just as loud. I don't even want to know how many times she's gone through this routine. And it gets worse. Apparently, she sees Edward in her mind when ever she does something dangerous. Or maybe she just went nuts. So to ""see"" her boyfriend again, who in reality probably would've broken up with her in a week anyway, she decides first to run away with some stranger on a motorcycle that's telling her how pretty she is. This idea is followed by fixing a broken-down motorcycle with some guy (at least she knows this one) and driving it through a forest. There was blood in this scene. When that got old, she decided to jump off a cliff. Get over it, Bella! ***END SPOILER*** At the end of the movie, Edward thinks Bella is dead and decides to commit suicide. Yes, vampires can do that. If you think about it, that's the same thing Bella was doing. ***SPOILER OVER*** Besides all that, I just wish at least one of the guys in the movie would put a shirt on. That's disgusting in my opinion, boys have cooties. I could not have stood to watch this in the theater around a million teenage girls screaming till their lungs were about to burst at every other scene.

It picks up right were the first left off, and is a very straightforward, eminently likeable romance/fantasy. The visuals here blow those of ""Twilight"" clear out of the water, though that gritty sense of teen angst and beautiful blue filter seems fatally absent--it is, after all, a beautiful story of teen angst. The introduction of the Volturi (the sort of Italian ""Vampire Overlords"") in this installment lifts the action considerably (especially in the third act), and the long, dreadful stretches of boredom one finds in the book are considerably toned down--though not entirely absent--here. This film is basically what the fans of the books are looking for: Hot, shirtless guys mixed with fits of action and an overdose of romance (it's also worth noting that the screenwriter does a very nice job of capturing things that teenagers actually SAY--a skill Ms. Meyer sorely lacks); but for those not yet ""induced"" to the Twilight world, this film, as with its predecessor, will do little to convince them.Show less",,3,Teen,14,13,12,3

This is the kind of movie your daughter wants to see with a group of friends and away from her parents. it is a mature and romantic movie, that parents may not approve of.
Terrible role models. all of them. Bella and Edward have a VERY unhealthy relationship. period.
I think Rosalie was actually the best role model in the film (as hard to believe as that is.) she was only shown abotu once or twice and what she said at the end about Bella willingly wanting to be a vampire was one of my favorite moments.
Well....there were plenty of hot, shirtless men in the movie. several girls ages 13-19 screamed when Jabcob removed his shirt....and I was one of them. This may be another reason why your daughter may not want to watch this movie with you. she doesn't want you to see her screaming and drooling over a boy for fear that you may baby or scold her.

Intense action scenes include many wolf-chasing-Victoria sequences, and the Volturi sequence in Italy features a supernatural
fist fight. Bella is loyal to her friends, and the Cullens and the Quiletes are very protective of Bella, presenting 
examples of positive role models and messages. Also has some real life brands shown briefly.

979,Twilight: New Moon,2009-11-30,"New Moon: Off the hook for age 12 and up, but perhaps a bit too much for younger kids (age 10-11 and down)","the only concern about this movie was that some swears were used. Not the bad ones but like what the h***. That was practically it. I'm not allowed to say it in my house so I thought I'd mention it. I'm religious; Christian. My parents thought Twilight would be another vampire movie, but they actually thought it was good. Good family movie and there was nothing bad about it, just the slightest bit of effusive love with Edward and Bella. But in New Moon, you'd think the depression Bella suffers is a dramatic period of time. But it wasn't, she's just sitting in a chair and time passes. The like first half went a little slow, mostly with the bonding with Jacob and Bella part. The action (which wasn't that violent) was pretty good (especially with animation of wolves) and starting picking up when Alice comes back to alert Bella that Edward is going to the volturi. The action picks up. The notorious fight scene with MArcus (one of the Volturi) and Edward isn't that bad. One of the  Volturi threatens to make Bella immortal (a vampire) but alice saves her because Alice tells them Bella will become one in the future. New Moon was a little more complicated than Twilight, but great. I loved it, and I thought it was the best. The end was a little abrupt, ending with ""
Marry Me, Bella"" but otherwise, this was a great movie. Humor is intertwined with it, and is a great family movie. It was not mature, but Edward is revealing himself to the commoners in Volterra, and if you read the book, he is shirtless. Older girls whooped but some of the younger ones like 11 and 12 year olds were a bit skeptical to open their eyes. But he quickly gets covered by Bella and then a red rob given to him by one of the volturi. Otherwise, GREAT MOVIE! Read the book as well, although the book describes things more, meaning much  more detail (good and bad) read the books because they're great.

Bella knew Edward for less than a year before she decided she loved him, could not live without him wanted to marry him and possibly give up her immortal soul for him. Edward is over-controlling, and a recipe for a rash of future abusive relationships in which girls think it is ok for a boyfriend to micro manage their lives.

1.It DOES show kissing and boys with their shirt off. but really conservative parents, do your kids not see shirtless boys everytime you take them swimming in public places? you do take them out to interact with others i hope. don't shelter them forever. anyway, and kissing is something they will learn about sooner or later. hopefully you parents do it in front of your kids sometimes, affection, when displayed the right way, which it is in this movie, is a beautiful thing.
2. It does have some violence. but hey,it's about vampires, if you're going to go see a movie about vampires and werewolves, don't expect them to be holding hands and sliding down rainbows.
3. the only even semi BAD message it sends, which would only come across as a bad message to the younger more easily influenced audience, is how dependent Bella is on her boyfriend. Yes i have had boyfriends, but im never as dependent upon them as she is.

I was oh, so hoping that New Moon would come and take away all my horrible memories of Twilight the movie. I'm happy to say that it did not disappoint. Thank you Chris Weitz! The acting improved drastically. I don't love Robert Pattinson, but I don't hate him with passion like I did before. All the other vampires were fantastic. Kristen Stewart portrayed Bella much better and Taylor Lautner was great as Jacob. The clan did good. The effects, such as the vampire speed, improved so much as well. There was no more blue tint in all the colors. The movie followed the book very closely, which I thought was great. They fit so many details such a short time. And the ending!

The heroine, Bella is depressed throughout the movie and does some very dangerous things just to make herself feel better. Also, one of the last few scenes are very scary when bad vampires try to kill Bella and her true love. A definite nightmare maker for younger children. Very fun for eleven and up.

1061,Step Sisters,2018-01-29,"Imperfect, but Entertaining and a Conversation-Starter","I'd like to preface all of this by saying that this movie will of course be controversial. Any movie regarding potential cultural appropriation, racial stereotypes, and heavy drinking will be. However, I think it takes a strong step in the right direction of conversations we should be having, and really shows its entertainment value with the choreography, spirit, and spunk.

Regardless of whether or not you liked the movie, we have to admit that it started conversations. And while there may be prevalent racial stereotypes, isn't that how real life is? I ask anyone who leaves a negative review solely because of the racial stereotypes (on both sides), is it possible to create a movie with racial themes without stereotypes? I think the exclusion of these stereotypes and prejudices (once again, on both sides) would be borderline lying. 

I give this movie a B- in terms of character development and about the same in terms of plot quality. It is a dance-rivalry, poppy teen movie at its core (which are, I admit, my guilty pleasure, having seen all of the Bring It On movies). However, there's more to it than that. It portrays strong examples of girl power and sisterhood, fighting for what you believe in, and choosing your own path. While the ending may be cheesy and the girls may be slightly stereotypical sorority girls (whether they're black or white), they're smarter than they act. 

Some of them make genuinely insightful statements that make us wonder where the line of cultural appropriation is, because as one character says (spoilers ahead but not really), ""White people thought we were stealing their culture with Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters, and we thought the same about Eminem. Races can't own things."" I definitely misquoted that, but you get the idea. 

Definitely controversial. So as a reviewer, I'll leave my personal beliefs out of this. However, whether or not you agree with this statement, if we take a step back for a moment, the arguments on both sides really do make sense. Is it really fair for a race (minority or otherwise) to take sole ownership of something, not allowing any blending, adapting, or integration? On the other hand, is it really fair to take something so special away from a culture, especially one which has been deprived in the past and has suffered so much?

Yes, it's a movie about white girls trying to do what the black girls do best, and of course they get a lot of hate for it. It's pointed out numerous times that the way the white sorority feels, judged and despised by the black steppers, is how many of the black steppers or blacks/African Americans in general feel far more often, or even always. 

As a side note on other messages, drinking is portrayed as pretty glamorous, although (minor spoiler) a character experiences the very realistic consequences of her actions, so it's not all fun and games. The movie is very low on the violence and sex fronts, with some consumerism at parts, although it's made fun of. There is quite a lot of swearing though, so if this is something you or your child is sensitive to, perhaps this is not the movie for you. I'm hesitant to put a rating on the ""great messages,"" since I know that there is much controversy regarding what constitutes cultural appropriation, even amongst individuals in a single culture. Therefore, I know that some will love the message of cultural ""sharing"" and others will find it sacrilegious. So I suppose I'll agree with the messages for the purpose of this ranking.

I wouldn't be mad if everyone disagreed with my review. And perhaps as a parent, you've already had so many of these conversations that a lighthearted movie would do you no good. On the other hand, maybe not. And if you have a teenager, particularly one living in a more sheltered community, it might be worth investing a little over an hour and a half and showing this to him/her. Agree or disagree with the movie's message, I think you might be surprised what your teenager has to say on the matter.

So once again, at the end of this rather long review from a teenager, I genuinely do think this movie is worth watching. Don't judge it too harshly; after all, it was written to be a fun, dance-based movie that could bring an important (and little talked about amongst teenagers) conversation along with it. It is not meant to be the next allegorical statement on the racial climate in the world today. It's no masterpiece, but it has some interesting things to say, and it does so in a format that appeals to younger people--not to mention, the choreography is pretty awesome.Show less",['Positive Messages'],2,Teen,17,13,13,4

There was heavy drinking, one of the girls worked in a strip club to provide for herself as she was a foster kid but she’s only shown coming out fully clothed. There are no sex scenes but there’s a lot of talk about it and the main characters boss is opening gay. Though it’s only talk.

1079,Starship Troopers,2017-09-23,"Fantastic Satire, But the Joke is Easy to Miss","Review: 
Starship Troopers works both as a great sci-fi actioner, and also as a fantastic satire of many things, among them being fascism, American foreign policy, militarism, and above all, it's very own source material. The great thing about this movie is that while you may not like it the first time you watch it, the more you think about it, the more the reason for it's puzzlingly bad acting and excessive gore become clear. It is making fun of it's own genre. Think Ender's Game, but instead of Ender going off to repent for what he has done, extreme patriotism leads the soldiers to reward themselves for their hostile efforts with more war.
This film exhibits lines like a news reporter saying ""some say the bugs were provoked by the intrusion of humans into their natural habitat. That a live and let live policy more preferable than the war with the bugs."" To which our hero, who has pretty much given in to the war and propaganda says ""I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!"" Showing how humans would react to something like that as a result of their actions.
The imagery used in the propaganda that the audiences are shown is subtle, but it really drives the point home if you get the joke. The over the top gore and violence isn't merely some dudes fascination, but is instead used to show the horrors that may come from our aggressive actions, and the fact that a peaceful species retaliating causes us to try to destroy them shows the state of our governments, and is still a topical plot point to this day.
While no one knows the intentions of the original novel's fascist imagery to the letter, many speculate that it is promoting it instead of satirizing it, and this movie takes aim at it's own source material, a gutsy move that not many studios would want to attempt, in fear that they would alienate the core audience. But, this movie does so with gusto, and in doing so, comes out on top as a winner. I would highly recommend it, because even if you don't quite get the massive joke that is this movie's premise, the special effects aren't even half bad by today's standards, utilizing creature effects when possible to make some truly terrifying, brain sucking, fire spitting foes for our not-so-heroic heroes, and the fight scenes are actually pretty cool to look at, even if they don't have many of the elements from the novel such as the power suits.

Content: In all seriousness, the only real problem is the violence. While there is quite a bit of female nudity, it's largely in non-sexual shower sequences. With that being said, there is one scene with sexual nudity, but it doesn't last very long, and it isn't essential to the plot, so you can skip it.
Sex: 3/5

Believe it or not, this film actually has a very, very strong message, but it is hidden inside of the big joke of the film. For those of you who might go into this movie expecting the typical sci-fi film that the trailers suggest, it is actually a very sharp take on characterization, making us sympathetic for ""heroes"" who are really just a lot of @#$holes. The big thing about this movie is that humanity has invaded a planet with peaceful aliens, trying to wipe them out, but when the aliens fight back, humanity uses things like propaganda and other enticements such as citizenship to lure young teenagers out into the stars to fight a war that should never really be fought. Humanity's craving for violence is what causes all the problems. Other than this, the world government is painted like a fascist regime, and it really works. These people who start out as innocent high school students become murderers, believing that they are defending humanity when they are far from it. If the humans just hadn't attacked the bugs in the first place, they could have had a mutual relationship that would be beneficial for all, but humanity's lust for blood makes sure that that would never, ever happen. To find the positive messages of this movie, you must think contrary to most modern cinema, asking yourself ""why SHOULDN'T I be like these characters, and how can we avoid this future?""
Positive Messages: 5/5

As far as language goes, it's nothing above a PG-13. The only swear words said are very few and very mild, with the exception of just one F-word.
Language: 2/5

This brings us to the major objectionable issue with this movie. It is absolutely vomit inducing in the way of violence. Well, it wasn't vomit inducing for me because I've desensitized myself to gore, but for many, it could be absolutely traumatizing. People are melted, chewed in half, stabbed by very big alien limbs, and even have their brains sucked out on screen, and it is not very pretty. The effects are actually quite convincing. In one pivotal scene, (mild spoilers) a character takes off his helmet during a training exercise, and he is accidentally killed by bullets to the brain. This scene is very shocking, and it marks the point where the film starts to become very gory. Keep in mind, most of the violence is part of the satire and is played for laughs, but that makes it all the more shocking. The movie opens with a very violent moment that lasts about two minutes, and then for the next hour, it is relatively calm, but after that, it delves into non-stop chaos, with each character's death more shocking and gory than the last, until the very final moment. Try not to get attached to any of the characters, because half of the message of this movie is about showing what war will do to our children. In addition to the fighting, there is a scene where a character is whipped, and it is relatively graphic, showing the whip tearing the flesh open with blood trickling out of the character's back. I believe that the reason why this movie doesn't really have much bad language is because if it did, combined with the violence, it would have received an NC-17 rating, which in my opinion, it probably deserves. 
Violence: 2000/5

You should probably watch this movie on an empty stomach if you are light-hearted, but for those who are able to get past the over the top and realistic violence, this film is a very large field of ripe, intelligent and timely satire that will seem stupid to most people, but will be incredibly funny for very intelligent people. It is all one big joke, and the studios involved really don't care if you get it. Just relax and enjoy the ride.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff']",3,Teen,17,17,18,5
1080,Starship Troopers,2016-12-09,"Turn you're brain on and see satire, or keep it off and just have fun.","This film is probably one of my favorites, and it's not just because of the raw entertainment value it has, but also because of how it manages to be ""Stupid"" in a ""Smart"" way. (If that is possible)
At face value the movie is a fun little adventure which is exciting from start to finish, appealing to a very basic, and instinctive, yet powerful part of you're psyche.
In particular the whole movie feels like a big Convention or event of some kind.  Especially for teenage viewers, it feels like a high budget visualization of a fantasy you would come up with without much thought. Lots of soldiers fighting lots of giant alien bugs with destruction everywhere. and by the end, it feels like a satisfying journey.
But upon closer inspection, this film isn't nearly as simple as it seems.
It's not too hard to figure out that the society the characters live in is supposed to resemble fascism or dictatorship. But they aren't in the same state of torment that real dictatorships face in modern day. This universe appears to be a  version of American society in which everyone honestly thinks they are free, but all are just tools for the government.
The military in this world sends thousands of young soldiers, just out of high school to their untimely deaths just for a slight tactical advantage.
And the soldiers themselves have a view of reality so narrow minded all they think about is is the war, not why they're fighting, not who they are fighting for, just the war itself.
And that's where the real political commentary comes in. The war crazed society this film portrays could plausibly become American society in the future. As is the military already brainwashes it's soldiers into machines rather than people. Now imagine how greatly that position of a ""ideal"" soldier became a glorified cornerstone of our culture. and that's what this movie wants to convey.
Oh right this is a parental rating site :P

1102,The Clique,2018-01-05,Great Teen Movie!,"The Clique is a great movie for teenage girls. The movie taught me how not to handle bullies, thanks to Claire's irresponsible approach of dealing with Massie Block.  This movie made up my childhood, and lets be honest, I still watch it whenever I'm bored to this day. There is some language in it, but its nothing your teen daughter probably hasn't already heard in school before. The worst cuss word they use is bitch. There is a lot of consumerism, because the girls go to an expensive private school in New York. Their parents are wealthy (SPOILER: MOST of the girls parents are wealthy...), and do spoil them. The girls are sassy, but that's the whole point of the movie. The plot is about sassy rich girls! It's basically the younger, more appropriate version of Mean Girls! Some people say that teenagers will find this movie childish after a while, but I still love it, and so does my 17 year old sister.  In the end of the movie, Massie, the main character, wants to pop out of a cake for her crushes birthday, and her outfit is somewhat questionable, considering the fact that she's 12 years old. She has a mini skirt on, ridiculous dangling silver earrings, and a black crop top that reads, ""I &lt;3 Chris"". Lets just say, she looks obnoxious. It is pretty slutty, but if you're concerned about your kids watching this part, it's pretty easy to make it clear to them that her outfit is not appropriate, especially for her age. That's what my parents said to me when I first watched this film. Another scene that you may want to skip through would be the scene when Claire has her first day of school. In art class, Alicia reaches over and ""accidentally"" spills red paint on the back of Claires pants. Everyone thinks that Claire got her period. It's not inappropriate, because it's something completely, 100% natural that will happen to every girl out there at some point. But if your daughter/son is younger and you do not want them asking questions about what's happening, you can easily go to the next scene. Overall this movie is fantastic, and in the end, I took something away from each character. Massie's leadership, Claire's kindness, Alicia's loyalty, Dylan's humor, and Kristen's Intelligence.

This movie is the best. But it's DEFINETLY not for little kids.

Although Kristen is the nicest out of the whole group, she laughs along with the girls when they hurt Claire, or she helps with evil plans the girls come up with. Overall, the group is snobby, rich (except Kristen), rude, selfish, and cares about nobody but theirselves.

Plus: There is BAD language in this movie. Like Claire and Lane call Massie a b*tch. Plus, one of the girls say ""pissed"" and Massie says to Claire ""Go back to wherever the hell you came from.""
Little kids shouldn't be using that language.

1185,The Last Airbender,2014-09-30,"""The Last Airbender"" movie review","""The Last Airbender"" was absolutely horrible. I was just amazed by how bad this movie was. The movie is based on a TV show which is 10,000 times better than this piece of crap. Everything with this movie is bad. There is not one good thing about ""The Last Airbender"". The acting was by far the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie. The actors were amateurs who had no idea what a movie was. The plot was handled in such a boring way. The TV show had a fast-paced plot. This movie was just boring. There are so many stupid things about this disaster other than the acting and the synopsis. For example, the air karate is horrible. The air karate is handled so badly. The action in this movie is stupid as all hell. The lead role was bad. Noah Ringer is a bad actor and so is all his supporting actors. The villains are so stupid. They are procrastinators who are idiotic as hell. This movie lacks another big thing that makes a good movie. It is called a screenplay. I'm pretty sure M. Night Shyamalan doesn't know what a screenplay is judging by how bad this movie was. I don't know what the hell M. Night Shyamalan was thinking in his tiny mind. I respect directors who try their best, but the movie turns out being bad. Shyamalan wasn't even trying. He wanted money. He knew that ""The Last Airbender"" would earn lots of cash because kids loved the show. So, he decided to make the biggest piece of crap ever made in the history of cinema without even trying. I would cut up his film-making license right in front of his face. I remember myself as a nine-year old walking out of the theater so disappointed. I don't remember being more disappointed since 2008 when ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was unfortunately released. ""The Last Airbender"" should have been called ""The Last Piece of Garbage M. Night Shyamalan Will Ever Make"". Anyone who tells me ""The Last Airbender"" was a good movie has to go to a psychologist. It pains me to give ""The Last Airbender"" one out of five stars. It should get no stars because there is nothing good about it. This movie is the absolute worst movie ever made. Also, it is my least favorite movie of all time. Because it is so bad, I think of ""The Last Airbender"" as a curse word and insult. In my thirteen years of watching movies, I have never seen a movie that was so horrendous.Show less",,2,Teen,13,9,9,1

This movie is absolutely atrocious, just so bad that it actually induces laughter at its sheer awfulness.  The dialogue is something my five-year old cousin would probably be disappointed with, the plot is the most trite, unoriginal stuff ever with elements from LoTR, and star wars among many, many others, and the acting, dear god what acting? the characters register zero stage presence at all, telephoning their lines in? more like telling their agent to text them in a week later.  Aang is a bright and exuberant little kid in the show who radiates energy.  Here he's a wooden board.  This movie is an emotional black hole of failure and is bland in every way, from its shockingly bad visuals to again, the characters. I might rate it an eight, but please reasonable parents, don't take your kids to see it, don't hurt their eyes and if they are fans of the series don't crush their hopes and dreams under the sheer weight of misery this movie conveys.

1190,The Last Airbender,2010-12-01,Horrible in Comparrison,"I was saddened. No offence M. Night. The acting was horrible and it sounded like they were reading streight off of the script without stop. Noah Ringer showed a tad of potental I admit, his acting was good in some places, but the results still were a downer, the boy hardly smiled and his air bending looked like he was pretending to be an octopus. Katara was always so emotional, and she seemed more like a little girl than the 'motherly' figure. 'Soeka' (or as I call him) Soaks all of the fun out of everything, didn't match Sokka at all, he was FAR too serious, he always looked so angry and he hardly said ANY funny lines. And for Zuko, they must realize he growl in EVERY sentence he said in the cartoon, in the movie he sounded like he yelled everything. 'Eroh' I must say was a promising actor, but he wasn't as layed back, but the actor wasn't too bad. Although they need a chubbier actor, excuse me saying so, but Iroh was short and fat, not tall and skinny. None of the characters looked themselves, Aang sort of did, but not really, it looked like they obviously shaved his head. Katara and Sokka were Innuit, not pure as snow white, they could have hired African American's even for that role. The Fire Nation was Eastern Asian at least, not Middle Eastern. Especially Zuko in the show, he looked more Asian than most of them. As for the Earth Kingdom, they should just have all Asian actors for that one, not just TWO. They made Haru a little boy, and at the end, the girl that plays Azula is in her twenties, when Azula was only 14 years old, like Katara. If they could find someone around Katara's age to play the role, they can find a young girl that looks like Azula ('I' even look like Azula!) The affects were decent, but they were moving far too slow, they could have just rolled out of the way! The thing with the Fire benders needing a 'source of fire' is silly, if that was true, I don't think they would have gone as far as they did in the war. The people that were 'bending' looked more like they were just moving their arms all over, it hardly matched. You just couldn't relate to any of the characters, you could hardly grow on them. The set just seemed... cluttered. Little fun. Ozai didn't look scary, the characters look nothing like they should have, the names were said wrong, Appa looked like he was from ""Where the Wild things Are"" while Momo (his name was never said) looked like he came out of a video game.

1194,The Last Airbender,2021-03-11,Ew,"So, I am a HUGE (and I mean HUGE) fan of Avatar The Last Airbender, and I knew that this movie would be horrible, but I had to experience it for myself. There’s so many things wrong with it, that they shouldn’t have even tried to make a movie out of the best TV show in existence.

Basically, the first thing is the characters. In the show, Aang is a boisterous, happy, and slightly immature,  however, in this movie he has NONE of those traits. And to make it more “Asian,” he’s known as Ahng, which is actually how it’d be said with an Asian accent, yet he’s played by a Caucasian kid? Geez. Sokka, or Soeka, is the comic relief character in the series, and in this movie, he doesn’t make a single joke or even smiled (maybe twice, but still). Zuko doesn’t have a scar, or an actually noticeable one anyways, and Iroh, or Eero, isn’t at all the wonderful, fun tea-loving person he’s supposed to be, he’s just another dry character who offers little to no advice to Zuko. Also, all of them were played by HORRIBLE actors who looked nothing like them. In addition to that, they got the races of every single character wrong. I don’t really have a huge problem with that, yet, the characters were drawn a certain way, meant to look a certain way, and that was the way they were supposed to be. They had wonderful designs, and the movie ruined that.

Also, the plot line. Ugh! They took random parts from random season one episodes and threw them together inaccurately! Obviously, this was going to happen if you try to throw twenty-one twenty-ish minute episodes into a single movie!! And it didn’t flow! Also, the Bending was super slow. And they all were super weak. Another horrible attribute it has is that the CGI is bad. They could’ve a least tried a little harder in that section! Also, the characters weren’t developed at all! Sure, they sort of tell you about Aang running away (although it was kind of for a different reason) and sort of showed Zuko getting his scar, but it didn’t really tell you about their personalities.

Also, it was BORING. REALLY, REALLY BORING.

All in all, this movie was a MISTAKE. It shouldn’t have been made! But, if for some reason, you have an urge to watch it, it’s not violent and there’s no cursing or use of dangerous substances. There’s one kiss scene, but it’s pretty brief.Show less",,2,Teen,13,9,6,1
1195,The Last Airbender,2021-03-01,Don't watch the movie before watching the cartoon,"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my whole short life. If you decide to watch the movie, I would highly recommend watching the Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series and watching at least Book 1 first. 
Here are a couple of my reasons why I don't think you should watch the movie:
1. First of all, whitewashing the characters as the main characters in a film that is supposed represent Asian characters is really sad. It doesn't help that the characters portrayed by Asians in the movie are weak and helpless, or cruel.
2. Even though ATLA is about a kid trying to stop a war, that doesn't mean it has to be solemn. One of the reasons people like ATLA is because it is FUNNY. Aang is a carefree kid who would rather ride giant koi than try to learn waterbending, and Sokka is just a guy who likes meat and his boomerang, for example. The Last Airbender removes all of the jokes and the actors constantly have sad faces.
3. There was a lot of CGI needed to recreate bending and the animals. Unfortunately, the bending wasn't instantaneous and the animals were just plain creepy. Take Appa, Aang's Avatar companion and flying bison. Appa in the cartoon is cute and cuddly, but Appa in the movie looks like a monster from Where the Wild Things Are.
4. The names of a lot of the characters were changed to be more ""realistic"". 'Aang' was turned to 'Ong', 'Sokka' to 'Sohka', and 'Iroh' to 'Eehroh'. I don't care how realistic it sounds, I just want the pronunciations the same as the cartoon!
5. Finally, a lot of characters that were important were never introduced. Bumi, the king of Omashu, Suki of the Kyoshi Warriors, the Freedom Fighters, Haru (since the earthbending boy didn't have a name), and (most unfortunatly) the cabbage merchant.
In my opinion, the movie is really bad and it will NEVER be as good as the original series.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models']",2,Teen,13,9,8,1
1196,The Last Airbender,2021-02-16,"Live-action adaptation is bad, but not as horrible as people say; a bit more serious than the cartoon","The Last Airbender is a pretty bad movie. It had a very rushed story, weak characters and wrong name pronunciations like Aang is pronounced “On”, Agni Kai is pronounced “Agni Key” and General Iroh is pronounced “General E-roh”. That said, younger kids who are fans of the show may enjoy some of the elements, but the movie is also a bit more serious than the TV show.
Educational Value: 0/5. While still set in an Asian-like setting, the movie is rushed, not giving it time for character growth or education.
Positive Messages: 2/5. The main messages are teamwork, friendship and non-violence. However, the movie is rushed, and not many messages are shown.
Positive Role Models: 2/5. Aang is non-violent and stops the Fire Nation without hurting anyone. Katara and Sokka join Aang on his journey. However, the movie is rushed, and not many role models stand out that much.
Violence: 3/5. The show is a bit more serious than the TV show. The four elements water, earth, fire and air are used in battle. Zuko uses swords in combat and threatens people with them. A fish is quickly stabbed and killed. (Possible Spoiler: A character sacrifices herself, which may upset younger viewers.) The Fire Nation is a bit more scary than in the TV show.
Sex: 1/5. At the end of the movie, Sokka and Yue flirt and share one kiss. Uncle Iroh tries to convince Prince Zuko to “look for a pretty girl” and stop worrying. 
Language: 0/5. Very mild insults.
Consumerism: 1/5. The movie is based off of the popular Nickelodeon animated series, and has some merchandising tie-ins.
Drinking, Drugs &amp; Smoking: 0/5. In one scene, The Fire Nation makes a toast, but it’s not clear what they’re drinking.
Overall, The Last Airbender is a pretty bad movie. I don’t recommend it, but you can try it if you want. However, kids younger than 9 may want to skip this movie for some of its more serious moments.Show less","['Positive role models', 'Violence & scariness']",2,Teen,13,9,9,2

1211,The Last Airbender,2020-07-11,Avatar: The Last Airbender The awful and the ok,"Growing up watching the show I was so excited for this movie but to see it crumble as this bad version of it came out. I watched about 40 minutes of it and I got real thought it was almost over until I saw I had like an hour and a half to go. The acting is horrible, I completely understand that some of these actors and actresses are young or haven’t been acting for a long time, but with some better directing they could have pulled it off but it just was horrendous. There is just some flirting and one kiss so no nudity or sex of sorts so your child would be just fine watching it. The movie is very slow paced like I said I watched a little of it and thought it was over until I had realized that there was still quite a bit to go. If you child is young they won’t mind this as it is mainly for a younger audience but if they are older and can understand movie making a little bit more I suggest watch the show and not this as it will ruin the show for them as it did I. When it comes to the gore factor there is fighting and some fire and explosions but no gruesome stuff like blood or anything of that sorts if you get sick form that. I know it’s a movie so a lot that happened in the show had to be taken out but you will miss out on a lot and may not understand some of it like you would on the show. Many things weren’t pronounced correctly like some of the characters names. I know that most of you know this has come out I. 2010 so 10 years ago and coming up on 11 well we still have generations to come so they might see this. It is truly a bad movie with very few good moments but not none at all. Some may say I’m just defending the show and not naming anything good about the movie. Well that could be correct because there are very few things good compared to how many things are bad about it. If you enjoy the show or you are thinking about watching it well than I suggest that you don’t watch the movie because it may spoil the show for you and I highly suggest that you go watch the show because for short it is, it is a masterpiece and very fun to watch and people of many ages enjoy it. If you are considering watching the movie be prepared to be bored for a while and remember that the show will be or could be ruined for you. Not the worst movie budget wise and some moments are quite good or cool but overall it is a sad adaptation of a great show. 1 out of 5 stars rating just awful. Also note that there has been some controversy over the casting because in the show these characters are Asian, and in the movie they are portrayed as white people. Honestly it is what it is. I wouldn’t have chosen white actors to be portrayed as Asian characters but we can’t change that because it already is a thing. So skip past that because it won’t change throughout the entire movie, so if you have a problem with it all I have to say is that it’s not the actors fault that they are white and are these characters but it did happen so if you have any problem with it just move past it because it won’t change and just enjoy the movie if you can. Also this movie leaves out a lot of the actual moments and it’s cut down so much that some stuff may not make sense and too be honest this movie makes no sense entirely. It also changes the script completely and some of the memorable dialogue is cut out and it really makes it not fun to watch. If you told me to go watch this and tell you the good parts well there is barely any. I watch movies and even if they are bad I try to do a little bit a justice for it and find the good parts well all I have to say to that is good luck you are going to need it for how bad it is. I say to someone reading this don’t watch it at all it is boring and it just sucks in general. I’m not speaking as a parent either I’m still a teenager and trust me even though I’m young I still know what a bad movie looks like and this is one of the worst. But I can’t stop you from watching it just be prepared for the sheer awfulness of it.Show less",,2,Teen,16,9,8,1

1213,The Last Airbender,2020-07-11,Absolutely Disgraceful - Don’t even bother watching,"This AWFUL movie doesn’t follow the show AT ALL. It’s completely humorless, it lacks the important messages that were in the show and completely disrespects everything Avatar: The Last Airbender was supposed to be. Don’t even bother watching this garbage. It’s not worth your time or your kids. For instance, Aang (it’s pronounced Ang not Ong) leaves the southern water tribe village because the village sees him as a threat, but when he sees that fire nation ships are at the village, he  flys back on his glider to keep the people safe. Zuko, a prince trying to regain his honor, threatens Aang that he’ll burn the village to the ground, but Aang doesn’t give up without a fight. But, in the moment of truth, he looks behind him and sees the pain and fear in the tribes eyes and decides to go with Zuko. In the movie, they completely disregard this, instead of him being noble and brave. They show him hiding with the children in a cloak. And then he talks with Zuko and goes on his ship. That’s it. Nothing meaningful, nothing empowering. Just words on a screen. And don’t even get me started on Appa. Also, might I mention, the directors chose a cast that was ever more disrespectful to the show. The show is based in East Asia and majority of the cast is American. I wish the actual creators of the show had more of a say in what went on in the movie. It would have been so much better and every member of the Avatar fandom wouldn’t have to cringe at the name “The Last Airbender.” Also, don’t mean to sound too stingy about makeup and effects, but I’m pretty sure Aang’s tattoos are blue and where is Zuko’s scar? It’s barely visible. I think a 3rd degree burn on your face would be more visible.Show less",,2,Teen,16,9,7,1
1214,The Last Airbender,2020-07-06,Disgrace to a flawless TV show,"If you have watched the original cartoon, it’s a perfectly amazing show, where it has a great storyline and characters. Aang is a brave air nomad and the avatar, Katara is a girl who wants to master water bending, and Sokka is a humorous guy who makes witty jokes and comebacks. The movie didn’t capture thier personality’s at all, Aang is now a worthless weakling who doesn’t feel shame in running away, Katara is a bore with NO HAIR LOOPIES, and Sokka is a blunt guy who doesn’t know what he’s doing. Even worse, the main antagonist Zuko, is supposed to be a banished fire nation prince, determined to do anything to capture the avatar, yet in the movie, he gives up easily and his scar is on the wrong side of his face. Iron is supposed to be calm, in the movie... he’s just messed up man. 

Each bending style is supposed to represent a diffrent Chinese martial art style, which the cartoon perfected, i can say, since I do martial arts my self for several years. Each element has key features of the martial art it is represented by. Striking blows for fire bending, strong and steady stances for earth ending, free flowing for water bending, and circular rotating for air bending. BUT IN THE MOVIE’S YOU JUST DO A BUNCH OF HOCUS POCUS AND WAVE YOUR ARMS AROUND LIKE A MANIAC, and a feeble amount of element comes out. Just as strong as piss. There is a scene where a bunch of earthbenders do thier thing, but it takes freaking 6 people to barely move a small rock. Why not just pick it up and hurl it a fire nation soldiers? 

Another insult to the great and respectable cartoons is fire bending. In the original series, the Firebender is able to produce fire from nothing. In the movies, you need a source of fire, which is completely pointless.

Another point I would like to add it the impact. The TV series were supposed to launch a season 4 of ATLA, right after the live action film came out. But thanks to the horrible movie, season 4 was cancelled, which I would’ve liked to see very much.

the voice acting, the animation tone,the characters, the plot all of it was beautiful.  this show was able to balance between humor and dark topics. 
each character is beautifully written from Azula to Aang to even the cabbage guy.
Sokka was the best comic relief ever and he didn't come off as annoying

Some of the most important scenes in the series are cut out, haphazardly done or miss the point completely. And this is just for the characters.

The filming is done dreadfully (especially in the action scenes), making it boring to watch. Dialogue and action never meet which makes it even harder to watch. Graphics are terrible and so is the acting at some points.
The characters in this movie are completely different ones from the ones we know and love from the series. I could rant about how poorly this movie was made but I won't because this film doesn't even deserve that.

The three of them go to see the Earth Nation and Aang tells Katara and Sokka that all he learned how to bend was air but not water, earth or fire. They go to the Northern Water Nation so Aang can learn how to bend water but the Fire Nation finds him here. Will Aang and the Northern Water Nation be able to defeat the Fire Nation?

and water bend a koi fish to defeat the Fire Nation fleet, but all he did was
make water rise and then they retreated. Also they killed Zhou in a very different
way then n the series. If I could name all of the HUGE mistakes that they made

1230,The Last Airbender,2016-07-27,A high age rating because no kid should watch this movie - ATLA fan or not,"Let me get this straight: when this movie first came out, I was pumped along with every other ATLA fan.

I really wish that I could like this movie because it had potential.  There was decent CGI and a few parts were okay, but otherwise...

First of all, why, why, why, why (!) would they pronounce Aang's name like Ong (like 'ah' when you open you mouth for the dentist) when his name is clearly Aang (hard A sound)?  I think that it was all part of trying to make it sound more serious, but the ATLA cartoon was never really that serious.

Let's move on - why doesn't Zuko have a legit scar?  That's one of his defining features and if they can't even have some sort of costume, his whole character is for nothing.  (Okay, maybe that's a big cold, but the scar is pretty important in terms of his scariness.)

On the same topic, Katara looks nothing like Katara.  Neither does Zuko.  

Overall, a badly made movie that badly portrays ATLA that should never have been made.  I wish that they could remake this movie into something at least a tad bit more decent.  Anyway, don't watch this movie unless you want to set yourself up for disappointment.  I didn't give this an accurate age rating because nobody, any age, should watch this movie.Show less",,2,Kid,12,9,18,1
1231,The Last Airbender,2016-06-23,Why. Just why. This film... Why,"Screw this movie (apologies for the language). This Is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. And I've seen batman and robin. Shamylan can be talented. The sixth sense and unbreakable are great movies. Signs is an enjoyable thriller. The visit was fine. But every other movie he has made is laughably bad, and this is the icing on the cake of crap (again apologies for language). This is the live action adaptation of the beyond amazing last air bender show, which I just adore. This movie though, is incredibly boring and dull with appauling acting, terrible action and awful writing. The CGI is passable at best, and the costume and set design is fine, but when your movie is so bad that you can't even pronounce some of the characters names right, you have done something horribly wrong. The entire movie is just exposition scene after exposition scene, and it's not compelling. They miss out on some crucial parts of the show, like the Kyoshi Warriors, the fortune teller, the Pirates, the firebending master, The winter solstice, sokkas sense of humour, and anything that gave the original show character and fun. Please, if you're interested, watch the better in every aspect original cartoon, you won't regret it. But you will regret watching this cinematic equivilant to watching paint dry immediately. Hell, watching paint dry would be more entertaining than this. Just, stay as far away from this disaster of a film as humanly possible.Show less",,2,Teen,13,9,2,1

At first, I thought it was pretty good.  It was pretty entertaining, but now looking back at it, the acting was atrocious, the pronunciation was not good at all, and the characters' appearances didn't look like the original series at all.

I would say not to watch it at all; instead, go watch the show!  It's much better.

One of my biggest rants is probably about how they pronounce Aang's name ""ong"" with an ah sound (like opening your mouth at the dentist), not ""ang"" with a hard A sound.  I know this sounds really nit picky, but it just bothers me a lot.Show less",,2,Kid,11,9,6,2

It was a complete disappointment - I'm rating this a ""two star review"" just because the CGI was decent. What drove me to pieces was the pronunciation of the name ""Aang"" in the film. It's probably the most obvious name in the whole ATLA series, yet everyone mispronounced his name. Also, there were plotholes, bad acting, bad directing, and most blatantly, the change of plot and characters' ethnicity. The plot was basically independent of the original series - it was like it was a whole other franchise. Not to mention that earthbenders needed a whole dance choreography to lift a single rock from the ground. 
Overall, it's like we're the Avatar gang watching the Ember Island Players. Yeah, that bad.

1252,The Last Airbender,2012-10-23,Not Shyamalan's best. Some peril.,"""The Last Airbender"" is a live action movie adaption of the TV series ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"". Being made by M. Night Shyamalan, who made both Oscar and Razzie-nominated movies, there was a 50 percent chance that this movie is going to be good. Also, it is based on a both critically and commercially successful cartoon series, so the expectations were big.
""The Last Airbender"" ended up winning the Razzie award for ""worst picture"", ""Worst Eye-Gouging Mis-Use of 3-D"", ""Worst Director"", ""Worst Screenplay"" and ""Worst Supporting Actor (Jackson Rathbone)"".
The movie is an adaption of the first season of the series, featuring the content of 20 episodes - all of which have about 20 minutes running time - in only about 100 minutes. There is nothing new, except that the movie is made live action. But the movie lacks both the charm and the originality of the series. Those who have seen the first season of the show will be bored watching everything again, only in a way that makes it seem like the episodes have been sped up. Especially the character of Yue is depicted much less important than she is. 5 Razzie Awards may be a little too hard, since the movie is not unintentionally funny or horribly looking, but it is definitely not exactly a great movie.
 M. Night Shyamalan can be a great writer-director - he proved that in his movies ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" - but it just seems that he is out of ideas.
(SPOILERS may follow:)
As for the age restriction:
Towards the ending of the movie it gets quite intense. There is a huge battle, in which people are drowned or flooded away. Several scenes show Aang's eyes glowing, which could be scary for younger viewers.
A minor character dies in the end by trading her life against someone else's life.

The little girl's voice grates on your earlobes to the point you want to leave, but no.

If you haven't seen the show, you have virtually no context whatsoever, and if you have, sit back and wallow in disappointment. It gives you almost no explanation for why there's a dragon located somewhere in Aang's psyche, or why Zuko was kicked out of the Fire Nation.

Night Shyamalon is that while his movies offer nice ideas, they are generally not very good. I particularly hated Signs, which remains to date one of my least favorite films of all time. At the time, the only good film he ever worked on, in my opinion, was Stuart Little, which he co-wrote. Now, a lot of people have been saying that his latest film, The Last Airbender, is his worst film. But, oddly enough, I think it is his best film yet. As with all of his films, the acting and script are subpar, but the actors do match their characters nicely, and all in all, most of it's flaws are spared by it's amazing visuals. I was especially pleased by Dev Patel's performance; he's no actor, but his portrayal of Zuko was very dark and deep. I think he should have won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villian.
Parents should know, however, that the film is darker and more violent than the TV show, and it's less humorous, too.

They could have at least had the decency to mess up all the names to inform us that they are just stupid, rather than making themselves look even more like idiots by changing the names on purpose. Iroh = Eroh, Sokka = Soaka, Aang = Oang, according to this piece of poop movie. I recommend to anyone, even someone that got this for free, to NEVER watch it. They messed up the races too, in the show the water tribes are Inuit, the earth kingdom would make sense using american actors, and the fire nation would be more asian. Not Water Tribe = American, Earth Kingdom = Extremely Asian, Fire Nation = Indian (Note that the only reason they are Indian, is so that M. Night could be in the movie.) I especially hate how M.

Sokka didn't joke at all (the sequel BETTER include Cactus Juice. OR ELSE I GO IN TO RAGE MODE) and his name was pronounced soh-kha.
Aang didn't have the same personality...the actor was terrible, and his name was pronouced Aahng.
Azula didn't look evil or pshycotic at all. She looked cute. THE MAIN ANTAGONIST IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE CUTE. Not in Avatar's case, at least.

Storyline: TERRIBLE!! The one general problem with cramming a whole season of cartoons into an understandable one-and-a-half hour film is that you leave out LOTS of important characters, events, etc. I've seen movies where this happened, but this takes the Cheez Puff. They left out so much stuff that the movie barely related to the cartoon series. If M. Night seriously wanted this to be reasonably understandable, he would make it a TV series. And what's with the repronounciation of the characters' names? Sokka became Souka, Aang became Aung, Iroh became Eeroh. Pretty much the only character names that stayed the same were Katara and Zuko. If you've NEVER seen the show, this will make as much sense as why Sam doesn't like ham in Green Eggs and Ham.

Special Effects' Quality: EVEN WORSE. Throughout the movie, it seems more like the ""benders"" are dancing than trying to throw the four elements (Water, Earth, Fire, Air) at each other. M. Night, this ISN'T a musical! And this is still like 80's special effects, like they would make an old Veggietales movie with. Get a new computer, you old dopes. One of the most disgracing scenes that proves my point is a scene where Aang, Katara and Sokka are in a Southern Earth village. When they turn back on the Firebenders, a group of ten people start dancing the same thing for fifteen seconds, and that gets a rock only three feet tall off the ground, and then it takes five MORE seconds to throw it. And I don't know if the flying rock was in slow-mo or not, but either way, it shows that the SFX crew is using a 1985 Macintosh. The ONLY times it has a little more ""modern"" SFX is when Aang's eyes and tatoos glow. If you like modern SFX more than that, then this will be a boring movie.

Overall Quality: For those who haven't seen the cartoon but HAVE seen the movie, the movie is a complete disgrace compared to the cartoon series. If the director was smart, he'd separate it into parts( like the Lord of the Rings) instead of making a suckish 1 hour 43 min. waste of time. It also leaves out key characters like Suki, King Bumi, etc. As well as events that make the story make sense. Another thing is that the movie has 0% humor, and 100% suck.

Even if I hadn't been a big fan of Avatar: The Last Airbender, I would have utterly hated this movie. I tried not to be critical when I watched it, but it was so boring that I ended up pulling it to bits just to get some entertainment out of it. 
Characters were completely the wrong nationality. There was no humour, and I found the bending frustrating (for example, it took about 15 earthbenders stomping in unison to lift a medium sized rock and send it forward very, very slowly). Firebenders can rarely produce their own fire in the movie, which I find takes away from the whole fear-of-the-fire-nation factor. 
The only character that looked anything like their cartoon self was Yue, and she's only a minor character. Characters that seem unimportant at the start but are really important later, such as Suki or Bumi, don't feature at all. 
The movie doesn't exactly follow the original storyline. I have the entire 3 series of the cartoon on DVD, so I know what's supposed to be where, and what becomes important later on. They don't just skip parts, they replace things that, in my opinion, shouldn't be messed with (eg. instead of the current Avatar asking past Avatars for guidence, they ask spirits).

Don't bother with the movie - just stick to the cartoons. The characters are better formed and there is a lot of comedy.Show less",,2,Teen,15,9,10,1

Since I know no one will be reading this to read me ranting about those details that were missed in the film from the actual show, I'll cut to the chase. First, the acting. It was ok, except for one guy. Zuko. He was an absolute ham! A tip for anyone reading who want to act or direct in a movie one day; just because the character is confused and angry does NOT mean that he should yell and shake every chance he gets. Now for the film work. I love close-ups. They show you the character's true emotions! Now, when you do close-ups in almost every shot just for the fun of it, then I get upset. Now, most importantly, the Bending. It was accurate, and did incorporate many martial arts movements from the shows, but there was something missing. Maybe I just liked the cartoon bending more because it was so fuid and cool, whereas these were sometimes choppy and awkward. Overall, If you want to take your kids out to see this, alright. Just be prepared to explain the entire movie to them, seeing as they assumed everyone watched the series and went on with the film that way. If you are a serious Avatar fan, see it for the Banding and maybe just to see your favorite characters on the big screen. Just be ready to rant later about how many parts it missed. Honestly, if the people who made this had put half as much effort and time into it as those who made films like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars prequels, they would have nailed it.

I will admit, Noah Ringer is showing promise as an actor (but he needs to SMILE MORE!), Jackson Rathbone was pretty good for a devoid-of-humor Sokka (SO LAME), Dev Patel was spot-on as Zuko, and Shawn Toab did a nice job as a tea-jokeless Iroh. Everyone else...please go to an acting class or SOMETHING. It was pitiful to watch half the cast stare at each other and show no emotion. Most of that was because of the story and script, but whatever. And also: what was with all the benders doing ballet before actually bending objects?????

I probably would have liked it a lot better if the pronounciation was correct, and anyone who's seen the show would've gotten it right. Any humor in the story was removed, and the acting was definitely not the best. I thought Jackson Rathbone made a perfect Sokka, so it's a huge bummer that it turned out how it did. Oh. Don't even get me started on Zuko. The casting for him completely failed. Y'know how he's supposed to be really disfigured because of his scar? They could have just toned it down a little bit, but his ""scar"" was just three lines on his hair that were missing. I was expecting much, much better for Zuko. The only thing good was they followed the story and didn't add anything to it. Plus, If someone who hadnt seen the show saw it, they would be completely lost.  The first time you hear Appa's name in the whole thing is when Sokka says ""We can fly there on Appa!"" so people would have no idea who appa is. Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed. The series is almost 100x better. watch the tv show before seeing the movie. It will help TONS.Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Positive Messages', 'Positive role models']",2,Teen,13,9,8,2

I'm also quite grateful that those tickets cost nothing.
First off, I must say that graphically speaking, the film was nothing short of gorgeous- but nightmarishly inaccurate. I don't want to give anything away, but many locations were totally incorrect. Nonetheless, the visuals were excellent.
The script, however, did not stay true to the original show, nor did it make that much sense. The trouble is, Shyamalan left major plot holes, only those who enjoyed the original show would understand exactly what was happening and why.
As far as fantasy/action films go, it was relatively mediocre.

1326,The Last Airbender,2010-07-02,Only for diehard fans of the TV series,"When I first heard there was an Avatar movie coming out about a year ago I was extremely excited since I was a big fan of the TV series.  After seeing the movie I must say the wait wasn't worth it.
     Though this movie failed on many fronts it was ultimately the script that killed it.  The conversations felt hopelessly unnatural and from time to time the characters would spew out completely unnecessary or unrelated information.  But the worst part is the script had no soul.  The humor that brought the television series to life was missing, leaving just a bare-boned, overly dramatic story.  The only humor to be found was of the unintentional sort (A Tai Chi scene that looked more like dancing at a especially dramatic part of the movie set me into a fit of laughter).
     The acting didn't help the script either.  Though most of the minor characters were serviceable the leads weren't nearly as good.  I understand there are limitations when working with child actors but is this seriously the best they could cast?  The actor who played Katara was the worst offender.  She looked just like the cartoon character but her narration was emotionless and her acting was awkward.  The boy who played Aang wasn't much of an actor either but fortunately he kept his mouth shut for most of the movie.  Patel, who played Zuko, did a decent job, but considering how well he played his role in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" I expected much more.  Also, a personal disappointment was that Uncle wasn't fat.  I felt that his rotund figure was an integral part of his ""enjoy life"" character.
     The special effects were the high point of the movie.  Appa was a little strange looking, but the bending effects were impressive.  The sets were detailed and really brought the cartoon to life.
     For the most part there aren't any inappropriate elements.  There is fighting in the movie so if your kids are going to wail every time it gets a little rough this is not the movie for them.  There was one drowning scene that I felt was a bit too graphic for younger children but otherwise this movie should be suitable for all ages.
     In the official “Commonsense Media” review it was mentioned that the target audience for the movie was “8- to 10-year-old boys”.  The problem is, though “Commonsense Media” is correct, that shouldn’t be the target audience.  Avatar, the TV series, has captured the imagination of thousands of people regardless of gender or age.  The fans, male or female, eight or forty-eight, deserved more.  If you’re dieing for new “Avatar” material go see it, but don’t expect anything other than a flashy but poorly acted and scripted movie.  Perhaps the sequel (If it ever materializes) will be better... Perhaps…Show less",['Violence & scariness'],2,Teen,17,9,8,2

This drink just happens to have a racy name, as aforementioned ... Another thing that shocked me is the particular ""shower scene"". She's seen sneaking into a guy's shower (He's not in it), and this scene implies nudity - only shows neck to the lower back and nothing else- but before he hops in the shower he hears a noise, and goes out of the bathroom - with a towel on- to check it out, where she promptly steals his boxers (note: everything she does is because some girls made a list for her and her friends to follow. after her mother told her not to leave the house) There's one use of the H word and some making out, references to ""hooking up"", and omigod but no actual cuss words.

He was in his shower at the time, so it was kinda weird. And in the end there's some making out.

He writes all his dreams into a dream journal, which is stolen by the class bully, Linus. Linus marks on all the pages with a black sharpie. When a tornado hits his town, Max is taken to planet drool by Sharkboy and Lavagirl, where he saves the planet from being covered in darkness, and learns to dream with his eyes open. Linus has changed his dreams, and is the new ruler of planet drool. Max stops the darkness, but Mr. Electric, the teacher who is now a dream-stopping manic with glowing arms and legs and a giant face, goes in the tornado to the real world t hurt people. Max and Linus awaken from the dream, but turns out if you believe in a dream strong enough, it will come true. Using a ""Crystal Heart"" which appeared somewhere in the movie and did nothing, a student who was the ice princess in Max's dream freezes Mr. Electric and it starts snowing. Max'a parents, who were geting divorced, suddenly get back together because max dreamed it, and Sharkboy searches the ocean for his father while Lavagirl rules the earth's underwater volcanoes. The whole movie had terrible animation, and it contained no other meaning than to dream of things. The whole thing was super confusing, and there was no point to a lot of aspects. A giant floating robot moth and eyes named Tobar appears and gives Max advice. The most disappointing thing was the costuming. Sharkboy  was wearing a rubber fin, and Lavagirl's ""flaming hair"" was dyed pink. Kids might enjoy a little bit of potty humor, but there are no role models to look up to. Sharkboy has fits of rage where his teeth turn pointed and he rips apart a cage. Lavagirl spends the whole part of the movie trying to figure out her backstory, which never actually happens. She almost dies, but Sharkboy throws her into a volcano where she figures out that she is light. Not destruction, not a ""simple flame."" One positive thing was that Sharkboy and Lavagirl are very different, but they are loyal, and they look past their differences to become friends. I was very confused through the whole movie.

As for an example, the movie talks about the train of thought. This is represented by a literal train. When you watch the movie, you will know that in order to get to a certain place, you must stay focused. This obviously symbolizes our thought process. You see this a lot more in the movie. Adults should also understand that while they only try to point out where there are issues such as the profanity that is not present, they need to understand that no 5 year old is going to be looking for that in the movie, nor will they even think about it unless they were not raised properly. As for violence, the only “violence” in the movie is portrayed in a cartoony fashion and the creator found ways to add scenes to counter any fear a kid may have. The only issue in the movie is that the graphics are not that great.

You get Sharkboy and Lavagirl, a fantasy adventure starring two young superheroes born from the mind of a shy young boy, alongside a whole nother universe with an ocean of milk, fudge-spewing motorcycles, and more. However, while kids may enjoy the vibrant playground especially in 3D, the movie itself is actually quite awful. The movie is fueled by literally nothing but Razzie-worthy visual effects and crummy screenplay. It simply falls flatter than flat at every turn, even with its countless number of bells and whistles. However, kids will be too immersed in the movie's world to even care about the movie's ample shortcomings.

Good golly. Why do people even watch this thing?

It's certainly not for the production values- with a cast of almost all kids and George Lopez, everyone's either overacting or gazing off into the distance with a deer-in-headlights look. It also relies heavily on cheap 3D gimmicks and computer animation, both of which are now hopelessly outdated. 

The plot is also a little fishy- once Max and his (imaginary?) friends reach Planet Drool, the rest of the movie is scene after scene of tedious expository dialouge, with the occasional cheesy tune or action shot thrown in. 

Despite its flaws, The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl is really a cute (albeit rather obnoxious) movie about following your dreams. It's worth a peek- not in 3D- and maybe a repeat viewing or two.Show less",['Positive Messages'],2,Teen,15,7,6,3

I liked it alot, although I always love any horror movies, especially when they are somewhat realistic (no aliens,demons,etc). This movie had some horror movie cliches, but the characters weren't overly stupid. CommonSense Media forgot a couple things in the violence section. A girl pierces her own ear with an earring. All that is shown is her pushing it in and then a close up of it coming out the back and a drop of blood on her finger. Also, a girl rips another girls belly ring out, it isn't really shown, you see her grab hold of the earring and then hear a ripping sound and the girl screams. A man is also stabbed, although all that is shown is the mans face and the girl who is stabbing him (no close ups). There is more creepy/disturbing stuff than bloody violence. There is language, but it isn't bad. Basic PG13 language, but i've seen worse in other PG13 movies. There is talk of sex (a girl seduces a teacher and he kisses her, the same teacher kisses a girl unwillingly, it is implied that a girl has sex but all that is shown is her face is quick shots in a sequence, a girl/girl kiss, and some mild talk) There really isn't anything that bad sex wise.

Wes Bentley was also very effective as Blackheart, with all his gothic-style makeup. Eva Mendes is perky enough for the love interest role, and Sam Elliot was nice as the stereotypical cowboy-type guy.

Silly Scooby believing the call to come in to the dark forest for a bag of ""Hamburgers"" makes me cackle.  Scooby's voice itself is something to just laugh at. Shaggy and Scooby's frienship plays a big role in the film, they not just try to be goofy because there are good momments in the film where you feel the bond of the frienship.  The only flaw about Shaggy and Scooby is them making the farting contest. As it just feels like the movie wants to be a big joke. Velma is a smart and sensitive woman. for you can see her bland side in a couple scenes. Daphne is too much of a grumpy, grouchy teen, not like the show. Daphne is constantly wanting to impress the gang that she can do something and that she is something more than grouch. Fred  is probably my least favorite character, for he is a bigger grouch than Daphne, he feels like he is the most important member of the gang and does not appreciate what Daphne and Velma do for the  team. Meanwhile he is  involved in sexy and drinking jokes and innapproppriet behavior. They litterly took what was good about Fred in the show and flipped it upsidedown. He is no longer a role modle but a character you don't want your children to be. So probably the best characters would be Velma, then Scooby, then Shaggy.  If you are a parent please I am shure your youngsters can see the movie without caring for the stupid sexy jokes or the drinking.

The movie has many fun action packed scenes, along with some humor the kids should like.  The only scene I objected to was the farting contest, I think we could've done without that.

Especially Scooby himself, who looks about as realistic as he is in the cartoon. And finally, the acting is unexplainably atrocious.  Freddy Prinze Jr.?  His hamminess is the stuff of legend (at least where I live).  But to the film's rather miniscule credit, Mathew Lillard as Shaggy is at least passable. As for inappropriate stuff?

The second thing is that the script has some occasional moments of wit. But in nearly every other aspect, this movie falls flat. The jokes are all flatuant, and the CGI is truly awful. Plus, none of the monsters are scary. So the point where this is inappropriate is all its suggestive humor. I mean, wasn't this targeted at little kids? You'd think I would like its mature humor, but I think it's just too dumb. But like I said earlier, it's script is okay, and the casting is spot-on. So maybe some old Scooby-Doo fans will revel in a bit of nostalgia for a while, but once they see the burping contest between Shaggy and Scooby, I'll bet the only thing they'll want to do is cry.Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff', 'Language']",3,Teen,13,10,7,2

If you are a parent and you honestly think that your teenage/tween child hasn't been exposed to violence or language before then that is just insane. This has to be one of the only movies I remember from my childhood and I loved the humor and how the gang had to solve the mystery.

There is also some brief non-sexualised nudity. VIOLENCE/GORE - There are multiple scenes of strong gore and strong violence, sometimes directed at young children. A young girl is referenced to have been and is briefly seen tortured alive over a fire, and although the scene is lacking the strongest detail, it is still very disturbing and unsettling. There is also a scene where a woman is ripped apart by barbed wire with copious blood spray and gory detail.  Other gory/violent scenes include a woman who has her skin ripped off by a large supernatural being, a man who is stabbed in the throat (bloody), a woman who is burned alive, a woman who is beaten repeatedly by three men with metal pipes, a woman who is stabbed in the chest, and a gruesome image of a man suspended on a high metal fence with his internal organs spilled out onto the floor. PROFANITY - Occasional strong language (""f*ck""), and some milder terms. DRINKING/DRUGS/SMOKING - Brief alcohol consumption. THREAT/HORROR - There is strong horror throughout, as well as sustained sequences of threat. Many of the monsters have graphically contorted bodies and sinister appearances in general. Some of the monsters appear to somewhat be in great pain, such as a monster bound by large quantities of barbed wire. The elements of torture explored in the narrative, especially considering young children are involved, are highly disturbing.

It is about a mother and daughter who crash their SUV at the entrance to a town named Silent Hill.  When the mother (Radha Mitchell) awakes after the crash, she discovers her daughter is gone and enters the town to go find her.  And then as you might guess, horrific things ensue.  First of all, the violence in the film is very graphic and if you are not OK with anything above typical PG-13 level violence, then this just isn't for you.  The profanity is less than average for an R rated movie, but it's still there.  And there really isn't any sexual content to be mentioned.  The quality of the movie is disappointing.  It begins well and intrigues you to want to see more, but it soon goes on a down spiral and just becomes boring, convoluted, confusing, and anti climatic.

Also, a grim scene with a dead body over a toilet stall, tied with barbed wire, which proceeds to come to life, crawling around and moaning. Dark environment, and a sad ending, can make this a very depressing movie too. However, little to nothing in sexual content, though you don't really notice amidst all the monsters and gore. Their is one scene which is meant to be frightening, with zombie nurses that only move in light, trying to kill the heroine. However, I thought they looked more like something out of the ""Thriller"" music video, so it just made me laugh, despite some throat slahing and blood in that scene.

Silent Hill jumped on the films made off of videogames band wagon.  Silent Hill gamers may enjoy it because they get to see characters immersed in an environment that's terrorized them before.  However, if you are looking for a good movie, look somewhere else.  The story centers around a mother, Rose, looking for her daughter who is too creepy to care about.  The go to the ghost town Silent Hill because it's a place she dreams about.  From there it just becomes one nightmarish spectacle after another.  Silent Hill attempts to scare you with deformed monsters that spit acid, bugs, and giants with ten foot butcher knives.  Rose's search for her daughter is entertaining but far to slow and interrupted.  The movie is too long and tries to reach some higher meaning that it just can't quite grasp.  The ending is bizarre and unsatisfying.  In the end, Silent Hill fails as a horror movie, a thriller, a suspense film, and everything else it tries to be.

Maybe it was one of the best or good scenes. IDK. It totally depends on the taking capacity of the person. If the person is 18 years or older and still couldn't stand violence then I wouldn't recommend it to them either. Sure, Resident Evil contains a brief sex scene and nudity but that was only to lure more people to understand the deep meaning of the RE movies. The next movies however, doesn't contain sex scenes and just a bit of nudity. And as for swearing and drinking I'd say about average. I wrote this whole paragraph just because I love Resident Evil so much and Milla Jovovich's acting there is extraordinary. She is an extraordinary actress though. But my advice for always will be to watch any movie before showing it to your teen or kid or child because even some 18+ movies are known to have less or no sex scenes and beautiful or amazing messages and role models.

1715,Resident Evil,2008-04-09,A disappointing adaption of the video game,"Resident Evil is possibly the most disappointing film I have seen of late. That is saying something because if it didnt have any promise, I wouldnt feel disappointed. The movie starts off with a rather clunky beggining sequence, where the T-Virus rips through the underground facility the ""Hive"". Soon after a team of elite S.W.A.T-like operatives storm in, and head down to the Hive with 3 others. The movie takes a bad turn around the 30 minute mark, by      
killing off over half the team in a 1 minute(admittedly one of the coolest sequences in the movie, but done with poor timing) sequence. By doing this they eliminate some of the best actors before they can have a chance to shine, thereby excusing the director from having to think of a decent storyline. The rest of the movie from there on out is rather lame(very few battles with zombies), with many disjointed scenes, and loses steam up until the last 10 minutes or so. On the positive note the soundtrack fits this movie perfectly, although it isnt used in either of its sequels. This movie could have been so much better, its really sad. Possibly the most underused actor in the whole movie is Martin Crewes, who does an excellent job as techy Kaplan, but is  
tragicly denied the material I and im sure many others know he can handle. Hope you all liked this review.Show less",,2,Teen,16,18,not rated for age,3

1721,Super Mario Bros.,2020-07-14,Cheesy fun 90s cult classic that has its ups and downs. ,"1993 is my favorite year in film, there's a good variety of movies that came out that year, like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, The Fugitive, Cliffhanger, Mrs. Doubtfire, and so on. But for some reason, the movie that I think about the most, in terms of movies from '93 is Super Mario Bros. Now when this movie came out, there was a lot of disappointment from fans of the video games, and it has been clarified by many as the worst video game adaptation ever, and one of the worst 90's movies ever. However, I personally disagree with that statement, because I can honestly think of other movies from the 90's that I would actually prefer this over. Now, I didn't have much appreciation for this movie the first time I saw it, I just thought that it was okay and nothing special, but after watching the back story to the movie, the way the movie came out all makes sense. Because while everything was moving smoothly in front of the camera during the making of the movie, behind the camera was a whole lot of chaos and very little communication, and apparently it got so bad in fact, that the actors that played Mario and Luigi, started drinking heavily on set. So yeah, needless to say that the making of the movie was a mess. But somehow, despite how messy the making of the film was, the movie was released into theaters...and failed. Despite that, the movie is now considered a cult classic by video game fans. Anyways like I said, there's things that work with the movie, and things that don't. the things that don't work are very minimal and are very fun to make fun of. And the things that do work for the movie help heighten it's enjoyment factor. So with all that said, Super Mario Bros. is a movie that shouldn't be looked at through a nostalgia filter, because if you do that, then your bound to hate it. But I certainly don't, and I consider it very underrated.Show less",,2,Teen,17,10,8,3

My family did not pay for it, but I don't think that the quality of the movie stacked up to the fee, unlike the live-action Mulan. In essence of value, it's much cheaper than the average movie theater experience, but you still get a movie theater. It was loud and it tries to show different genres of music, but the music is the most pop like of each of the genres. The cast is filled with celebrities, even minor roles, and there's so many characters that it might be confusing to your young child. It was mostly an average movie, though what I'd expect from a sequel from Dreamworks. It was mostly an average movie with a just ""fine"" plot but you could be spending more time watching other things. Lots of music, but the originals aren't very good and the rest, basically the majority, aren't. Very poppy colors and interesting felt designs.

1758,Trolls World Tour,2020-07-08,"Fun, musical sequel focuses on bathroom humor.","Trolls World Tour is a pretty good movie. However, they seemed to aim it at kids only and not something teens or adults would like to go see. They should’ve considered making it more entertaining for teens and adults and not just poop jokes for the little ones. Hopefully, if they make a Trolls 3, they will consider making it more adventurous, something I wouldn’t mind seeing.
Educational Value: 2/5. The film promotes diversity, embracing who you are, friendship and loyalty, but mildly buried under all the bright colors and poop jokes, it’s not really certain your kids will pick up on that.
Positive Messages: 4/5. The movie promotes teamwork, friendship and being and embracing yourself.
Positive Role Models: 3/5. Poppy is a strong female lead that will stop at nothing to save the day. However, since she is focused on saving the day, she sometimes forgets to listen to what other people have to say, but she ultimately realizes that in the end. Branch is always ready for action and always there to protect his friends.
Violence: 2/5. The Rock Trolls are built on destroying cities and stealing the music villages’ strings. The Pop Trolls may also be scary for the littlest viewers. There’s also some humorous chase scenes, but everyone turns out ok. There’s also a few sad betrayals. In one upsetting scene, Poppy and Branch get into an argument, and go their separate ways for a while. A Troll humorously goes to Heaven, but is shortly revived after.
Sex: 2/5. Guy Diamond has a baby, and pops out of his hair, but it is played for laughs. There are also some male bare butts, and some farts.
Language: 2/5. “Fart”, “butt”, “Oh, snap”, “shut up” and “dumb” make infrequent appearances.
Consumerism: 2/5. There are old songs in this movie to drag the older audience in. Besides that, there’s some Trolls dolls and stuffed animals.
Drinking, Drugs &amp; Smoking: 0/5. In one scene, a guy plays the Sax to relax, and they see visions drunk people would usually see, and they also act like drunk people.
Overall, Trolls World Tour is almost as good as the original, but with a bunch of fart jokes and a not-as-good plot, it makes the movie a bit lesser than the first.Show less","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models', 'Sexy stuff', 'Language', 'Consumerism']",3,Teen,13,6,4,3

Anyway, I loved how they make kelly Clarkson a country troll. But why did they have to have different troll types? The 'different' music was really a pop version of rock etc. There are references of music history like how pop took over music. That just shows why all the trolls sung a POP SONG at the end (Just Sing) with only about 3 seconds of each type of music merged into it. So I don't really get the point of more trolls. Then, how branch has a crush on poppy while he sang I love you in trolls. Poppy probably didnt think it was in a romantic way. Poppy's looks at him are sometimes TOO flirty as well. Also, when they get new styles at the end (not branch) it's because of... BUY OUR TOYS!! This is the main target for any movie (some bigger than others) but this was too much.

First of all, there is too much advertising for this movie. In fact, I think dreamworks spent more money on the advertising than the actual movie. Second, there is way too many songs in this movie. In fact, if I had a dollar for every time they started singing, I would have enough money to rent the movie for 5 years. And finally, this movie is the reason why amc theaters are banning movies made by universal.

1770,Trolls World Tour,2020-05-01,Trolls World Tour Review,Trolls World Tour is an amazing sequel to the first Trolls movie. It has a very positive message (that all people have differences and skills and you have to learn to accept them). Although there is some scariness in *(Spoiler Alert)* the part where Barb and the Rock trolls destroy the troll’s city’s and the part where Barb turns other trolls into Rock Troll zombies but that’s pretty much everything. I love the educational value because TWT teaches teamwork and empathy along with respecting others and their differences.

Although there was a small, predictable plot it was kind of boring.  Most of the movie was singing and I love singing, but every 5 seconds a new (in my opinion) annoying song!  Some of them were fun, but not most of them.  Branch tries through the movie to tell Poppy that he LIKES her, but has a hard time.  This was kind of like Christof, and Anna in Frozen 2 if you've seen it.  Anyway, they work to stop the queen of rock music, Barb from taking over all other music genres.  One character finds his family, which warms your heart a bit!  Trolls World Tour was disappointing, and overrated.

Where to Watch: Netflix

MPAA Rating: PG for Mild Action/Violence

My MPAA Rating: PG for Violence, Fear, and Implied Language

Great Messages: 5/5
Perseverance, Self Control, Courage, Teamwork, Be Kind to Others,  Believe in Yourself

Great Role Models: 5/5
Many great role models.

Violence: 3/5
Bloodless, though half of the film is intense combat that will scare younger kids. Fistfights, superpower fights, and more are all intense though it's a total feel good film.

Scariness: 2/5
The monsters will almost surely scare younger kids, but also sinister looks and things that the aliens do, and people turning into aliens.

Sex: None

Swearing: 1/5
A boy stops himself from saying Sh*t and says doodoo instead. This will go over most younger kids' heads. Oh my god is said. No actual swear words.

Consumerism:  Not Noticeable
If you went to a rock climbing place and then to one sleepover, that's how much consumerism is noticeable.

Drinking, Drugs, and Smoking: None

The main character, Missy, has the power of ""lEaDeRsHiP"" and honestly anyone could replace her. Everyone in the story literally has the lamest powers- like ughhhh. It makes you go ""what did I just watch"".

and the CGI! AAA my eyes- the ship looks like they painted a piece of Styrofoam and called it a day.

The movie started off fine, and it had the potential to be a movie that could be watched again. Then this kid stretched his neck out longer than a giraffe, and it just went down hill from there. Well, when I say downhill, I mean to say that the plot became illogical and excessively complicated, and it was interspersed with corny puns and statements like ""...leading by example,"" or  ""all I had to do was to believe in myself,"" et cetera, et cetera. Not to say that those are bad things to be teaching kids, but it was just so overdone and so obvious. I think that this was a mediocre movie at best, but I can see how it appeals to the audience that is preschoolers to about second graders. However, some of this target audience probably would be scared by certain scenes in this movie, due to mild jump scares involving tentacled aliens bursting out of wall fans.

If your child will be entertained by the corny humor and (random) singing, then maybe this will work for your family, but if they want to watch something good that’d similar to this but better, then you should go watch Sharkboy and Lavagirl or Spy Kids.Show less",,4,Teen,14,8,3,1
1829,We Can Be Heroes,2021-01-16,Good story little violence ,"I Love this movie and there is little use of  ""oh my God"" and  (BIG SPOILER) The superheroes or heroics do get thrown to the ground and there is aliens but overall six plus me and my sister lived this","['Positive Messages', 'Positive role models']",4,Kid,10,8,6,5
1830,We Can Be Heroes,2021-01-16,"Better than I expected, truth be told.","I was expecting this to be completely bland, boring and bleh, but I liked the film quite a bit.
This film has the same bits of ironic humor from its predecessor, Sharkboy and Lavagirl, but it also has some genuinely funny moments and good action.
The film got a noticeable upgrade in the visual department, but not to a point where it's jarringly better than the original, which is nice.
The premise is essentially My Hero Academia.
The adults in this world are struggling to keep up their hero schtick and fight crime, so it's up to a bunch of young-ins to save the day and beat the bad guys.
Although, this film has less anime violence and fanservice ,replacing it with creative  superpowers and 2000's cheese.
Admittedly, the adults being less competent with their powers does make their scenes less interesting, which is unfortunate because it creates a contrast between the fun scenes with the superpowered kids and the scenes where the adults are waiting for stuff to happen.
Also, the villains aren't as good as Linus was in the previous film and the movie kinda lost me near the end.
But ultimately, this film is fun, funny, action packed  and has some great characters.
My favorites include Guppy, the little girl with insane shark powers who also teaches viewers a good lesson about hydration, and Wildcard, the older kid who has all the powers but never uses them until the end and just complains the whole way through.
I found him funny.
This film has superhero action, and that's it.

They thought it was great, and well, let's just say it wasn't boring. The characters are a little cheesy, and thought the plot is okay, the script is... um not the best. Based on other movies I've watched it's okay I guess. It's definitely aimed toward the kids, and doesn't have anything that disturbing or inappropriate, I find it entertaining, tho the green screens aren't the best, the acting is okay, and everything else is almost close to perfect, besides the fact that it doesn't make the most sense, and the jokes, aren't all that funny.

1867,Star Trek IV,2012-01-02,"Very dated, quirky and easily the tamest of the Star Trek movies","Leonard Nimoy directed the 1986 films, Star Trek: The Voyage home, which is, of course, the fourth film in the Star Trek film series. Previously, Nimoy had directed the third Star Trek film, The Search for Spock. So, I guess our very own Mr. Sock enjoyed the experience of making one of these films so much, that he just had to come back and make another one. Turns out, he made a really, really good decision: It was the highest grossing, most acclaimed and most loved Star Trek film until the masterpiece that is Star Trek: First Contact, came out. But, even that film didn't make as much money as it did. The story is unusual, even for a Star Trek Film: The crew of the U.S.S. enterprise must go back in time to San Francisco 1986, to find a pair of humpback wales, which have gone instinct in the 23 century, and bring them safely back there. Ridiculous? Heck, no! This is Star Trek! That's one of the many things that I love about it! Star Trek: The Voyage Home is also, by far, the most lighthearted and funny of the Star Trek films, which makes it pretty much a sci-fi- comedy. So, it is still fittingly rated PG: There is very infrequent sci-fi action violence which almost always maintains a comical mood and tone. also, there is slightly more frequent profanity, than in most Star trek movies, but it is also, almost always used for humor. And, finally, there is some frequent drinking and one minor drug reference.

1892,Howard the Duck,2020-11-25,Wow.... Just wow.,"The single most terrible movie I have seen in a very long time. I jokingly pretend to like it to annoy my brother, but this film sucks so bad. It is supposed to be funny, yet the only times I laughed were at how bad it was. The dialogue was cheesy, the special effects were terrible, and the idea of a duck that saves the world is the flat-out stupidest thing I've heard in a long time. This is the worst Marvel movie ever, and even though it's not a part of the MCU, it is still a Marvel movie. Look closely on the DVD wrapping. The Marvel logo appears there because Howard the Duck was originally a Marvel comic before it was adapted. Look up ""all Marvel movies ranked"" and it'll appear on most of the lists. I don't think I need to stress how bad this film is anymore, but I'll say one more thing anyways: I bought this DVD for $5.00 at a Walmart in New Hampshire. Worst money I ever spent in my life. Anyways, I always found it hilarious how desperately the film was trying to sell itself. Because by claiming it was good, the advertisers could have been accused for false advertising, so all they said was: ""One of the most talked about movies of all time."" Bruh. Just Bruh. An 11 year-old could advertise better than that. It is hard to believe that this production can be linked to such great household names like George Lucas (he was the executive producer; worst money HE ever spent in his life) and Marvel (one of their films).

Director and co-screenwriter Willard Huyck has taken Steve Garber's abrasive, beer-drinking and cigar-smoking comic-book character and castrated him, turning him into a wide-eyed cutesy-pie available for the toy shelves. Huyck's Howard the Duck is a being from outer space, blown into Cleveland by an errant laser beam. After a few minutes on Earth, Howard runs into rock singer Beverly Switzler (Lea Thompson), and they become fast friends after Howard protects her from a couple of nasty punkers. The film then degenerates into an extended chase, as Howard and Beverly are pursued by government agents who want to capture Howard before he can be beamed back into space.
REVIEW
As you watch ""Howard the Duck,"" you get the vivid sensation that you're watching not a movie, but a pile of money being poured down the drain. In the absence of anything resembling structure, character, point of view or sense of purpose, there is no place else for this empty project to go. What can you say about a comedy in which the biggest laugh is in the end credits? Reservations aside, it's hard to fault the tongue-in-bill high spirits of a movie like Howard the Duck. For all those who cottoned to the charm of the comic books, the duck stops here. The movie is too scuzzy to beguile children, too infantile to appeal to adults.Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff', 'Language', 'Consumerism', 'Drinking, Drugs & Smoking']",1,Teen,13,13,12,1

One F-bomb, (TV bleeps it out) A few uses of BS and the S word, (Bleeped out on TV) Some uses of the D-word, some uses of Hell, and some uses of the B-word. 

    One part shows two teens rolling around on a bed and kissing, although these aren't the main characters, they are the mean characters, and it is to show how shallow and gross they are. It's a quick part, only last a few seconds. Some suggestive conversations between characters. There's another part with the same mean characters and they are in bed, although they are clothed.

I mean stuff like this is still happening today (With Deadpool), except this time the creators stood their ground, and THANK GOD! We didn't need Deadpool to become this! But back then, they actually thought it was a good idea to make it less darker and more kid friendly. I would have been fine with that but they f###ed this up so hard that it does the OPPOSITE in a weird, twisted way. Batman and Robin's costumes have NIPPLES on them. Yeah, that's right. Very kid friendly. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the master of the most bad@$$ one-liners in  film history is forced to use some of the worst ice puns ever as Mr. Freeze. Poison Ivy is introduced in the most cliched mad scientist laboratory and dies and comes back as the villain in what s equivalent to a bikini. That is her character, so normally it wouldn't bother me. Poison Ivy does dress skimpy in comics, games, etc. but she wasn't wearing it when she died! and no, it wasn't torn or anything, and I highly doubt that acid mixed wit her, some plants and dirt transforms her into a stripper. Bane willingly goes with her, because he is probably a pervert. Batman and Robin go to a place were people bid on ""hot women."" and when Poison Ivy comes in, Batman pulls out A BAT CREDIT CARD!  WHAT THE F###ING SH*T! WHY THE F### DOES BATMAN HAVE A BAT CREDIT CARD!? Wouldn't someone be able to track the card's money source to Bruce Wayne's ban account and find out Batman's identity? Mr. Freeze then crashes the place and Poison Ivy falls in love with him and attempts to kill his wife. She blames it on Batman and then Mr. Freeze wants to destroy the world because supervillains. I mean really, when other villains do it it's usually not just because of one person. Oh yeah! Alfred's niece comes by from Britain (with no accent) and it turns out he is dying. So she becomes Batgirl and thankfully she doesn't have nipples on her costume. Everyone has a costume change somehow and stop Freeze and Ivy and tell Freeze that Alfred is dying of the same illness as his wife so he gives them the cure for the disease and WHAT THE F###!? If he had the cure the whole time then why did he go on with destroying stuff!? He wouldn't have been in as much trouble! Also his wife doesn't die after Ivy literally pulls the plug to her life support for TWO DAYS and Mrs. Freeze is at Arkham Asylum so Freeze can practice making the cure for her THAT HE ALREADY HAD THE ENTIRE TIME!

REVIEW
Of all modern Batmans, George Clooney bears the closest physical resemblance to the comic-book hero, but there isn't much to say about his performance because there isn't much performance to discuss. The movie has its entertaining flashes, but there's too much bat-jive and bat-hokum. In terms of new twists or narrative momentum. Poison Ivy, the sinuous villainess, is the only relief from the onslaught of spoofy humor, special effects and meaningless comic book mayhem. [A] loud, long and pointless spectacle. Batman &amp; Robin won't kill the popular series, but it ought to slow it down a tad. There's plenty to look at but nothing to feel.Show less",['Consumerism'],2,Teen,13,11,11,1

You dread hearing another word from any character. This may be somehow enjoyable for the little kids because they might not even realize how terrible the script really is. With this, the acting is awful. It's the smallest effort given by George Clooney and everyone involved. Visually, this movie is ugly. Messy and all over the place is the easiest to describe it. Neon, neon everywhere. It is nowhere near pleasing on an aesthetically pleasing view. It could be something that can fly over the little kid's heads.

And to top this deliciously BAD cake, Bat-nipples on Batman and Robin.

1941,Batman & Robin,2012-10-30,"Unintentionally funny, Razzie-nominated sequel has mild violence, peril.","""Batman &amp; Robin"" is the fourth installmant of the superhero saga by Tim Burton &amp; Joel Schumacher (in this case, the last one).
While all of its preceeders had some interesting, Batman &amp; Robin leaves out everything that made the first three movies good: there are no interesting characters, there is no superb setting and not even an entertaining scene of action - even though I think that action scenes are unnecessary in a good movie. 
One of the worst things is that all of the characters - that includes Batman as well as the villains Poison Ivy and (especially) Mr. Freeze - frequently burst out in jokes or word puns. Most of them are not even funny.
Also, the movie has a terribly looking set design: Customes that look like they were made for carnival, icicles where everyone can tell that they are made of plastic and a horribly colorful Gotham City (though it is supposed to be a dark city).
Also, there are too many shots of (clothed) pubic areas - that goes from Batgirl's breasts to Batman's buttocks. Was that supposed to make the movie look better?
In one of the worst scenes, Mr. Freeze can be seen singing and dancing with shoes in the form of a polar bear.
The actors are propably the worst that could have been casted. They are extremely unfitting, even though at least two of are great actors:
At first, George Clooney, who will later make a terrific performance in ""Up in the Air"", isn't the right choice for Batman. Especially since in ""Batman Forever"", Val Kilmer was used as Batman, who looked much younger than his preceeder Michael Keaton. Now, Mr. Clooney is the opposite: looking older than Michael Keaton, he tries to bring in some of his acting skills, but since the movie has not got much to show, it ends up very unfitting.
Uma Thurman, who at that time was already Oscar-nominated for the terrific performance as the cocaine-addicted gangster's wife Mia Wallace in Quentin Tarantino's critically acclaimed masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction"", is forced to deliver lines that are under her level as an actress.
Bane, one of the most powerful villains in the Batman universe, is depicted as a brainless, obese muscle man who frequently repeats every last word when a person tells him something. 
The highlight of this movie is Michael Gough as Alfred, who is the only person in this movie from which you can say has well written dialogues and a good line delivery.
Overall, you can't say that ""Batman &amp; Robin"" is not entertaining. It is fascinating because of his unintentionally funny script, its hilariously fake set design and its weird characters. At least, it is fun to watch - a comically bad movie about rubber libs, credit cards and frozen superheroes.
(SPOILERS may follow:)
The violence in ""Batman &amp; Robin"" is not strong, but slightly more present than in its preceeder ""Batman Forever"". 
There are experiments made on prisoners - we hear that a scientist drilled into a person's brain (nothing seen). This person then transforms to Bane (this could disturb younger viewers, but looks hilariously bad to older viewers). After this scene there is not much to worry about.

Violence: some stylized superhero fighting with minimal death and no blood. A few police officers are frozen with an ice gun. A few men fall over dead after being kissed by a woman with poison lips. 

Sex: Poison Ivy makes some innuendos, but they will fly right over kids' heads. There is some kissing and suggestive clothing.

This doesn’t even feel like a sequel to Batman Forever, because they are so similar. Batman Forever was campy and Batman &amp; Robin is just corny. The only actors that are good in this movie are the people who play Robin and Alfred. It made absolutely no sense to take Batman &amp; Robin in this direction. They should’ve made it like Batman Forever. I will say that even though this movie isn’t that good, I still had some fun with it. Even though everything is dull, I still liked seeing how Joel Schumacher made it. I don’t need to go over anything in here, because there is barely any violence and it is all cartoony.Show less","['Language', 'Consumerism', 'Drinking, Drugs & Smoking']",2,Teen,13,11,7,3
1947,Batman & Robin,2020-08-24,The worst movie I’ve ever seen... literally.,"Watch in horror as Director Joel Schumacher single-handedly destroys your love for the Dark Knight!

Batman went from the dark and brooding Michael Keaton in an awesome black suit, to a cheesy neon-suited George Clooney. Yep, that’s right. George Clooney. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a good actor. But why the heck would you choose him to be Batman? It’s ludicrous! But guess what! He’s not even the worst part of the movie!

The Director also apparently thought it was a good idea to take shots of Batman and Robin’s bat-nipples and bat-butts in the beginning of the movie. It’s literally... unbearable.

We’ve also got hilariously bad villains! We’ve got the unbelievable Uma Thurman who likes to go around kissing people to death, Arnold Schwarzenegger who can’t seem to go FIVE MINUTES without spewing some dumb ice pun, and Robert Swenson playing a Bane with no brain. Oh, and let’s not forget Alicia Silverstone as the incredibly cocky and sexist Batgirl.

We haven’t even gotten into the plot, the atrocious cinematography that makes me want to puke, or the ridiculous scenes displaying the Bat-Ice Skates and Bat-Credit Card.

Conclusion:
I’ve seen a lot of people give this movie five stars. I just can’t understand it. Maybe it’s the whole “It’s so bad, it’s good” thing. But for me, it’s just wrong.

Anyway, that about sums up my review. I hope you found it helpful, and I hope you don’t end up watching this atrocity :)Show less",['Consumerism'],2,Teen,14,11,13,1

The violence is not too bad; the only part you should worry about is when Bane gets injected with venom, and he screams for a long time.
The parts with Poison Ivy aren't necessarily good for little kids. Warner Brothers go over and beyond to make her as attractive as they can. When she blows dust in men's faces, their main goal is to kiss her as many times as possible.

Some stuff may be slightly inappropriate, but the content seems PG-level, so the PG-13 rating could be a little harsh. There is also infrequent use of mild language, mostly the H word. Viewers will hear Batgirl saying the D word and Robin telling her that it's not a good word. Underlying this, there are some positive messages, which include stuff like partnership. At one point, Mr. Freeze got angry when Batman showed him that Poison Ivy killed his wife and told him she was alive. Batman explained to him that vengeance is not power.

O'Donnell is back from forever, I enjoy him as robin, it works.  I think that the best casting decision was Uma Thurman as poison ivy, she fits the persona so well.

I can't say it is as good as Batman Returns and Batman Forever, but it is a little bit better than the first Batman, and it is a decent series conclusion. George Clooney isn't quite as good as Kilmer or Keaton, but he is a great Batman nonetheless, and he has some good chemistry with Chris O'Donnell. Mr. Freeze, while silly, is the only Batman villain so far who we feel real sympathy for, and Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a very dedicated performance, one of his best. Uma Thurman is delightfully sexy and seductive as Poison Ivy, even if her backstory is stupid (that's backSTORY; her backSIDE is great). The story of Alfred dying featured some genuinely emotional moments that are actually kind of tear-jerking. The only element of the film that I did not enjoy was Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl; she's attractive enough and I'm glad that Batgirl was able to make one film appearance, but Silverstone is a terrible actor, and the character felt like a third wheel.

2024,Catwoman,2016-10-03,It's okay...ish,"I thought it was going to be a boring mess... but it ended up to be a cheesy/corny fun movie. The CGI is pretty dumb, yeah. But that doesn't mean the movie is bad.",,1,Teen,17,14,10,3

2027,Catwoman,2014-03-18,Eeeh... Meowch.,"I don't think it was SUPER horrible. But... It wasn't super awesome either. It's somewhat forgettable and the effects are eerie and cheap and sometimes annoying. Characterization really sucks for Patience Phillips, but the Catwoman character is fun. The outfit is too skimpy, however, it looks cool in unison. I think Halle Berry fit as Catwoman (not like Michelle Pfieffer did) but the Patience Phillips character was just so dull.

To be honest, I'll say I only watch clips of it for the laughable cheese factor and the, like, two actual cool scenes. I don't hate it, but I won't buy it.Show less","['Violence & scariness', 'Sexy stuff']",1,Teen,16,14,11,2
2028,Catwoman,2010-09-28,"A bunch of kitty liter,a clumsy movie, and a too sexy actor","I thought this movie was horrible. It glorified violence, and sex. It had very bad acting.

2030,Catwoman,2009-11-19,"Mild in it's rating bracket, nice stunts","Speaking from the opinion of someone who doesn't get particularly attached to movies based off of American comics, I think this is a very good movie. I haven't seen all of the movies which Catwoman is portrayed in, but Halle Barry (sp?) fit the character well in my mind. I'm not saying it's a remarkable film, but I found it enjoyable - I don't see why people keep making a big deal over Catwoman's outfit: it's not THAT risque, and it's the essence of the character to act the way she does.
As to the rating, I think I watched it when I was 12 and had no problems; the violence is mostly surface, little blood, the most disgruntling part is likely when one woman falls from a window and it is shown how she landed; mild cursing, mostly stuff pre-teens already know, no f-bomb or anything like that. There's one scene where it's implied that two of the characters have sex, but it's dark and there's no nudity, mostly just kissing then it fades out; other than that there's innuendo throughout the movie.Show less",['Sexy stuff'],1,Teen,16,14,13,5
2031,Catwoman,2009-10-20,"Wow, did this one stink","I felt...almost honored to watch this movie. Truly, a movie so very bad must be a work of art. I mean, it takes talent to make a movie this incredibly heinous. I was absolutely stunned that anyone could create such a piece of trash, and watched the movie with a sort of fascinated horror. Don't watch this movie unless you're trying to torture yourself. Go do something useful. Like watched grass grow.Show less",,1,Teen,17,14,13,1

Well, except for the costume design. That's IT. All this film is good for is its frickin' COSTUME DESIGN. Looks like somebody spent a little too much money on the COSTUME DESIGN and didn't want to spend money on a GOOD SCRIPT or a GOOD DIRECTOR. This film's not for kids. It's not even for people with at least one brain cell. (Unless they're prisoners.) Here's what to do instead of watching Catwoman: Rent Batman Returns. Watch. Enjoy Michelle Pfeiffer's awesome performance. End of story.Show less",,1,Teen,15,14,17,1

2039,Catwoman,2008-04-09,This movie desverves catnip!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It Rocked,"I really loved the movie. i don't know what everybody didn't like it. It was a pretty good movie. Halle Berry was offered a part, and she played it to the best of her abilities. The writing probably wasn't good, but the acting was sensational. She really acted like catwoman, even thought Eartha Kitt was the best!LOL. There wasn't really any sexuality, just kissing. It is deffintely kid movie for ages 10+. There is no fowl language whatsoever. The action was coreographed wonderfully, and the wasn't that much violence. I don't think this movie deserved a Razze(Worst movie Award). The outfit is risque` but id suitable for catwoman.

It was truly horrible, awful, and every other bad adjective ever put in a dictinary. It was so bad that it was hilarious, and actually more funny than many comedies that have ever been made. Not on purpose, of course. Do not listen to the few positive reviews, because I do not know what those people were thinking.
